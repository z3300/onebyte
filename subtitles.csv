2,"Barstool Pizza Review - Brooklyn Square (Jackson, NJ)",b1atcvtcoBY, [Music] all right Frankie Pete's review time still trekking to Atlantic City this place Brooklyn Square three locations where it went we're in new where Jackson New Jersey a little confusing Brooklyn Square not Brooklyn none of them are in Brooklyn all in Jersey but I would say probably the number one requested place that I've been getting we've knocked out beaten elders big but this is everyday it's this guy grip Oh who owns it he's on the menu is up there he maybe it's because he always puts me in his crane post but I've noticed it I will say a little we called in the pizza order half an hour ago is zero people in there zero and they just didn't put the pizzas in that's weird also it's called square pizza but they have the round always confusing to me because clearly the square is their gold medal slice to go to but the way we do this the way I do this is round pie that's the gold medal for me so I did both we did a spa we're gonna give him the benefit out I wasn't coming here not right that's all but soupy now they may have been under the gun because they knew I was like how's you not to put the pizza there was no answers for that no answers and they have the order the kid who took the orders like no I took the order he said it to the guy he's like I don't know what happened one bite ever in those rules we will do this the square pie is still cooking see what we got Brooklyn square Phi 1 byte 0 flop there looks like good quality slice little football pizza Brooklyn squares except not to square yeah go yoga [Applause] sesame on the crust I knew I felt something there I was like whoo that crust has a little bit of a weird taste to it not my cup of tea though I'd like to cross me a fastball 99 this is movement too much movement swing-and-a-miss a little too crusty but Ivan said that to each the Rome some people may like that little twist that little curveball see I like the bottom so much I wish they kept the crust without the sesame seeds that's us me even though I had it once Frankie you think you're having a straight crust because that's what the top tastes like and then snaps it off I'm going 7/8 on this maybe an eighth one if they took the sesame seed off for me maybe an eighth one if they put it on field that's what makes the world go round I'll get the square so bring it out bring it out yeah all right so I don't know if that means the next Sun I mean the guy bosses the order right yes oh so this guy I heard him he's in there I walked in I said pick up a Dave he acting like didn't know and then he Church is like no you got the round in the square he's a story by the way bought they works there and that guy just he just dropped the ball on York right yeah see I like it by the way the weight difference between the square and the Brooklyn is about night day this thing weighs 50 pounds this is what you guys are known for right yes yeah the square it's a spectacular looking square slice this would be right up your alley you guys gonna walk right in holy moly what a slice I gotta let burn my face off Frankie this seems like this would be your type of slice I love everything about that [Applause] oh yeah oh yeah the thickness there so this is what people been talking about not what I just ate which I thought was good but this is what they know for Brooklyn squared not in Brooklyn in Jersey very confusing figure it out wrap your brain around it whew that was a fillet of sauces I went up my nose I thought there's a chance I got a jacket you're gonna love this slice Frankie there's if I know you and I think we've done 700 these there's gonna be like one of your premier slices [Applause] this is Sicilian like what would you call this I brought call that Sicilian says is that what you call it she'll even call it the upside down the upside down visit right slice more eight nine on this here I know your slice will do a reversal Wow eight 9s big time you may go higher I could see you putting this in nine I think this is the best Sicilian upside-down I know there's the terminology that's the best square slice maybe we've done in these reviews I do love this style pizza shout out to brothers on Long Island that's my number one Sicilian slice I know it goes against barelli's we don't sell Sicilian slice get over it I'm gonna try this right now oh yeah oh yeah well this is good what do we remember what I please hi square was no but this is some of the fluffiest super fluffy dough it also has the crunch on the bottom so you get through the first bite and then it crunches at the end I think 89 is a very fair sport I think it's right on it we got the owner right here - we just got no yeah this is a foam mr. Portnoy what's up Dave how's it going yeah we did eight nine eight nine on the square thank you thank you although we had a mishap with you here we had a mishap with the order a guy we had a missing

pepe's in new haven and he said they created a new haven new jersey mix i guess that means kind of like a bar style with new haven he's gonna give me the bar style after this um and his dad owns a place in north haven buenos of winnie's he said uber debbie just did it so one bite ever knows the rules and right there that is that is new haven so that's what he's talking about that char on the crust is new haven style are you guys in school with this i'm sorry i'm sorry all right what yeah did you do that purposefully is that on purpose oh yeah it is give him you do that on purpose yeah give up your name this guy did all this i can't wait to watch this do a fake fall behind a piece of review come on guys did it look fake or real fake a real spider yeah i mean come on you just happen to fall right was this day one started kindergarten stuff with that guy one bite ever knows the rules so we set in the see i see more of the new haven let's see what we got is it boston this is far more uh new haven style to me than it is jersey but it is a little bit on a little bit on the flop side is this school or like camp school still in session one more day left all right got it tonight's graduation you should come i really like the guy in there and i like this pizza i it's a little bit tighter like i people know i don't i don't sometimes grease the cheese whatever it's not my favorite it's still really good it does have the the you can tell his dad worked at pepe's you can tell it's in his blood i still can't believe that fell down uh i'm gonna i guess making mark right i'm gonna go [Music] it's good pizza it's very good pizza i can see why there's a line around the corner just to pick it up uh 75 murray's milk mill mill town mill town that's a review i got i guess i'm doing a bar pie says making another pie that's how i get these i hear you man you're right my man is the owner he spider what do you do to me he said ready in five minutes for the second pizza i apologize we're gonna get home at 4 00 a.m all right so this is your weight this is your bar style yep so now i people get on me because i'm from the south north shore south shore massachusetts bar style will be like personal style yeah it'll be like half the size in jersey they're doing a much bigger so here we go the bar style for the future other 10 places we're going today we're not doing this we can't do the 45 minute reviews because spider will miss fourth of july but he's first nice guy let's see what you think i'm going to like this more than normal i think this one more it's more closer than the style [Applause] then they're crispy no chance your first one yeah i can't tell by just looking at it and new haven's not super thin you know how we make them bigger new jersey and they make them small because our pizza is better and and you're talking about massachusetts that's massachusetts we're talking about that yeah and we make the the under crosstalk no they're apart from you well now we're getting a fight north shore south shore is great all right let's see what we got but this is not new haven't stopped by like i said yeah skinny yeah i'm not skinny you see i like this one more than the person i don't like but i don't agree with you that this is this is this is way more uh new jersey style maybe we'll call it meltdown style mill town middletown style we got it all right he made me he was getting me every he watched me and said five minutes it was 35 minutes but i think it was worth the wait for the score or what do people get more this is one of the first uh we just started doing this a couple months and it's starting to get a lot it's about 50 50 split but i see it going on the rise i like this one a lot more than the first one to be totally honest um it's really good [Music] i'm debating in between uh the two right now if you know my pizza reviews but the second pizza you should give me this one first even though i love this guy and he's got the whole family in the works i'm gonna go seven nine on this one could have been eight one seven nine right that thing 35 minute delay had to knock him down a point i'm saying that right in his face had to this is very good so if you're coming to maria depends on what you like i think the first is actually more new haven style but this is the better pizza in my mind the thing what do you what will you let me call up what do you say for it what's the difference uh it's just a thinner crust uh no but if i call up and order one on the phone uh maria's bar pie we bought it maria's bar pie is excellent all right so that's the review um this guy's dad worked the pepe's pizza guy nice guy but this is pizza and earth day even next we've had trouble cut what when he's beaten vanessa's that's his

49,"Barstool Pizza Review - Explorers Den (Philadelphia, PA) With The LaSalle Baseball Team",HxcjQDULlXY, [Music] all right frankie here we go peach review time we're at explorer's den uh campus of la salle which they tell me is the only restaurant get a quick quick get a quick vibe here frankie what's going on [Applause] so why we came out you can see the save lasalle baseball teams i don't know somebody tweeted at me it was you what a week and a half two weeks ago you're like hey because we're all in pennsylvania now doing the sports book he's like are you gonna save lasalle baseball it's like all right yeah sure tell me what i to do but there was no answer i didn't know what the answer was going to be and then we actually talked so so they cut the baseball program and he's like yeah we just need a cool like 15 million dollars so like what do you mean 15 mil it was 9 million and correct member on 9 million to save the men's team and then they get another six to uh save the women's softball for title nine so it's just two other women's sports which i knew because my buddies played i was telling him at unh back in the day same exact [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happened and it seems similar with the administration like if you're throwing out that number to play baseball you're not really trying to save the program you just want people to go away but you're making progress now right yep yeah i've gotten through the board and we're just trying to make the salad look good here in a negative situation so here's the thing frankie like i got money i don't got 15 million to be like hey go play like baseball i could buy the whole campus for 15 million flips around but you know you should be allowed to play baseball it's a couple hundred grand or whatever it is throughout the program so we gotta start putting pressure on lasalle to be like dude keep the sports like why wouldn't it this is what people come to college for to play d1 team so you're gonna start getting it going in pennsylvania even though i did think it was in pittsburgh until like two days ago but we got the whole program out here and if you're watching this how do people support you guys all right so you have a gofundme we have a mailing list but what's the gofundme do because that's just to get awareness going that's just to get more people that want skin in the game to actually donate to help this cause what are you do are we gonna have to raise 15 million are we gonna like figure out a way to do this we're working on business stuff behind the scenes trying to actually bring the school and make the school better by generating revenue that they haven't generated before so we have a lot going on but uh the public you've given us and doing this type of stuff is how we actually get to that point so we're getting close so it's just i to me being my brain it's like you just gotta put pressure on the school they probably thought hey we can get rid of the baseball program a bunch of sports and i'll give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] well people give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because you know it's a key part of school especially no no offense to lasalle but baseball is all they got here so let's do this then 1956. you says football pizza he made it fresh in charge so i'm going to give him a little bit of benefit there who else is tasting are you the captain no i i graduated like four years ago i'm just helping

and even we're in the right spot here for everything for the army navy and everything how did you guys find this spot uh got it perfect i have some nice italian breadcrumbs she tried to grill me she said i was rooting for navy that's incorrect i want on the record i'm rooting for army and hopefully but i think maybe we'll cover we'll know by the time this airs all right i'll we'll wait for the pizza now but i want to get a shot of what it looks like all right here we go established 1977 natalie's maybe a little bit of a backwards pizza view because as you saw we already did the pasta faceool uh and before i eat it first of all it's heavy but second of all before i eat it i i think i'm part of their family like i was in there for a good i don't know 25 30 minutes i met everybody this guy's trying to sneaky reverse it on us i see you can do it full he's like trying to be but i i met everybody who works there i took 9000 pictures i met families from other town i am part of the natoli family so it's going to be very hard if i for some reason didn't like this pizza not to give it a very good review and there it is super traditional looking now if you know how i do pizza reviews you'd know this isn't generally like my style very lava cake i think they redid it and again i said it the first time i don't even know i'd order pizza at this place like they have they got all this awesome like deli sandwiches and the pasta um here we go this is a dangerous situation with how hot this is they won't let me pay they're like you're part of the family it's against our religion you can't pay so hi how are you are you putting that up i thought you would i love it i thought she was giving me a gift i should put it on herself it's like a seven nine seven nine one bite ever knows the rules oh dog attack [Music] super fresh dough it is doughy it is cheesy it was not my traditional style but i go here 10 out of 10 times in a 7.9 for atmosphere for friends for everything it's a fair score it's a fair score so 79 natalie's secaucus 1977 and like i said i get the vibe nobody in the history of the world has gone in there once going there once again buy everything from your toothpaste to milk to eggs to deli sandwiches to the pizza and this just becomes your local store so seven nine you'll always go back natalie's i think is now dave natalie portnoy is my name so there's a review brother that was great and harry this is this is your spot right i was saying in the review i feel like i'm part of the family after being in there dave you have become

there hey we won soccer you're talking soccer yeah we won week we got a we talking sorry 1 ok I don't know what kind of fan are you well I don't watch soccer I got you know what soccer is soccer the sport when all your main teams stink then you then you start move the soccer the Hawks stink falcons stink oh I like Sarkis I'm we don't like soccer I do like soccer I'm a world traveler so when you're in different countries you pick up different sports like like rugby when I'm in Australia All Blacks is my team from New Zealand you know I mean so when you're out there you pick up when you when you traveling you pick up different sports because there's nothing else to watch so soccer South America soccer Australia in that area there's rugby this is an all time spin Atlanta right now or an it Lansing for the Superbowl yes there's a plane it's 28:3 everywhere that's in your face we're gonna win then all sue balls come here so you didn't 28:3 on the damn people I would have it probably melted off we're waiting so long what are you up for score here I'm grading this pizza this is like Oh even though it's cold it's like a 99.5 that's just crazy that's just great 9 point but that that would you rate it 6-1 place probably cuz it's cold because you were late and then they got a bad review I know you hurt your thumbs so it's all fine I like you not like it laughter you got banned anymore and we didn't even get one cap what if you get one calf away from you do not do that I've been laying it on do we not at the end of the video yet so okay I'm gonna tell you why I gave it a 9 the cheese is just so buttery the cheese and the sauce all of that together is just melts in your mouth and it's got a little sweetness to it I like peace of this house it looks you like let it go I don't know if I had to go that's what everyone said in Lent is the best pizza well tour of your own City well thank you no more 28 you three talk okay can we just let that go when we bury that I won't mention it again 20 83 in memory okay gone for it do you think the page is gonna win though right I don't want to say it but okay I'm looking at just looking at the Rams this year and their losses the defense has got to be they got to put more they got to put a lot of pressure on Tom number one so he doesn't get comfortable that's that that by the way is the most likely prototypical every analyst if you put pressure on any quarterback than honest yeah sad but he can just he can do anything so if you you gotta take him out of the game he well we took him out but he came back alright anyway so it's all about the to me it's about the defense of the Rams if the defense steps up then they could possibly win but the odds are more in Tom Brady's favor cuz he's been here you saw it you're probably at us how many years he's been in the league 17 years were you one of the guys I went to a Super Bowl you chance an ATL all you guys are so cute you're all in the crowding on ATL when you jump down to that lead and I was just sitting around like these guys know art is so cute no no no I need a rocking me and my squad we didn't get caught you lose like it's Bill Belichick and Tom break right assemble you don't never can underestimate these guys so see we've come a long way in the span of like ten minutes because I want to switch allegiances and join our band I'll let you then would kick me out of Atlanta all right so there's the review nine the jump two nine five they're both wildly high I gave six one it's a little joke okay I revised it since it's colder I'm thinking of it as hot so I give it a eight point two okay well we don't allow that once you do your first scores all right well good nine point five brother it is I think it was actually nine that's a review he did get here I like him again rappers are back allowed on Peter fees thank you yeah go Rams what I mean you

93,"Barstool Pizza Review - Pizzeria Posto (Rhinebeck, NY)",UHCnTHyufNQ, [Music] all right pizza view time i'm wearing ride back of all places why am i in rhyme back apple picking season when apple picking at a place griggs i believe and then i'm like all right let's just google great pizza good pizza this skort uh it is posto had one of the biggest scores around it was in the eights they knew i called on my cell phone which is a rookie move i can't do that because they knew it was me and they said 45 minutes i was like all right i'm out here i'm going to do it anyways so 45 minutes i walk in they're waiting for me they're like hey dave we set the total for what this pizza view would be 8.2 is the over under that means they think they have great pizza they also called rhineback which is a beautiful town walking around circles this place is very hard to find in a beautiful courtyard the new hamptons i don't know if i believe that quite yet but the town is awesome like walking the streets it made me just hate living in the city because there's the smell is fresh the air is there's a karate kid class with little kids and the stores are cute just like get me out of the city perfect fall day here we go so interesting looking paella i wasn't sure if it's gonna be neapolitan it's not and so again they clearly believe in their pizza to set the total at 8.2 i like how they put the basil on the side i am gonna like this i can tell by holding it i can tell by holding it also a good sign three kids who are uh were they the ones who stalked us over there no no we are you are we don't know yeah they are they're saying they are did i take a picture with you guys no it's a different group that stalk me thank god because they told me how to find this place anyways i think i'm going to like this a lot zero flop really posto one bite evernote's rules rhinebeck the hamptons of no man's land they're not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around it's really really good what are they doing behind me anything clearly in the eights not even a question if it's in the eight so their score of eight two kind of dead on to be honest weirdly i was gonna go higher but this slice how it's over you know what i like my pizza a little bit drier like it's a little soupy i'm gonna see how this one picks up like it's a little soupy i'm not going to change the score just because it gave it this is a dead ass push there's a push give your money back there's an 8-2 they they know their pizza so well they knew the exact score there again 8-2 it's a legitimate 8-2 score if it was tighter without it i'm egg on it up to 8-3-8-4 as it is great score so if you're apple-picking or live in this area or whatever it already had a bunch of reviews the new taste posto fine wood 8-2 earned it they knew it they were kind of cocky about it like 8 2 it's great pizza it is great pizza good luck finding it that's a review you

105,Barstool Pizza Review - Jet's Pizza (Special Guest Jason Derulo),S79-R7KvSjM, [Music] all right Frankie pizza review time we are encore of West 18th in 9th Avenue Jets pizza new special guest Jason Derulo you may recognize him from being in cats for his huge dog that has been all over the internet right now I said I was doing it with him yesterday Mike Jason Derulo I think big cat a bunch of guys like oh you stick yeah you up right uh-huh big man is hilarious who wouldn't love it I'd love that repetition he and I a little and calm and I was telling him water weight in the pizza that little sex tape snafu yeah don't you do so we bonded over that for sure Jetts pizza knows that she's from Michigan and I appreciate this first of all we got again reiterate cats you're in it comes out tomorrow nationwide yes sir I'm so excited I mean honestly it's been a very long time coming in this and it's such a departure from from boom is doing right now you know and I think a lot of kids are gonna be inspired by it so make sure you go check it out as a family family film watch it they edited out all the you know the big the big dong stuff so you're safe there also I listen to your music all day long people underestimate every song banger banger banger banger why here we go alright one bite ever knows the rules now you credit to you uh-huh you vegan so you don't eat cheese right so you created what I would say is one of the most unique slices I've ever seen we let him do it because you know he's doing the Riu no cheese Frankie you know we do cheese he put everything on a pineapple peppers what else you got on this mushrooms olives onions the whole nine so will you go order pizza on your own this style or you just want me pizza no I'll go order something like this okay but I've had one where they didn't put the marinara sauce and I'm vegan I don't know without cheese I don't always give reason so take this slice we score it by the way zero to ten Detroit style the first one in New York and the guy who works in there is the owner so we were to do slices he made it do it took a picture you score this thing zero to ten okay dude I don't know if I even consider this pizza without cheese is definitely piece of bro I don't know it's hey have you been living on the planet Earth minas alive there's a lot of vegans but no cheese no pizza that's like almost healthy to be white but is some bread some that's almost a bruschetta so we call that bruschetta that's a bruschetta so don't burn yourself but you score it lum bite zero through ten okay pretty good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just better than I thought I was gonna be what do they get Detroit the the squares and slices places what is that you know I'm talking about flying tigers lions Hagen squares is the other Detroit style in New York this is a pizza because it's all about the brunch and the algebra show ha ha and amount of amount of coins and to me it's all about the size as well I don't think is gonna be this good me neither I thought it's gonna be like a healthy like a bouquet I'm not gonna it looks good it's just not Pete you go first I always let the guests go first okay I'm not gonna live like it snuck a little cheese in here this is way too good um it was good he was listen what happens if you like melted cheese oh no no it's so good huh I just decided to like be very healthy man and oh that's how you keep that party you know a little orangey and the cats and the dongs I guess stop if I could do that yeah you can ma'am this is my livelihood I can't that's real yeah yeah be kind of weird if you was just started eating vegan pieces and all this whole franchise would die dead in the water now so listen so I gotta give this a pretty high score because it's way better than I expected awesome way better than I expected because you know usually when you walk into like a commercialized visa joint you don't really think much of it I'm in New York you know I'm saying I lived here for two years most of the time you go into like a mom-and-pop trying to spot and they have that you got a little cheese and hanging [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's way too embarrassing there you go right here a edgy there you go oh my god you got to tell him when you got something I appreciate it I appreciate it anyway so don't wanna be next to like a section they got your cheese on your face but whatever so I'm gonna give this like an eight point five whoa hi hide for the bruschetta so 8.5 first ever [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] by the way Frankie we talked to the owner that they opened right in this guy's face Stella pizza that is in wild move and we asked them you probably have it like did they care is like it's like opening Coleman shop what are your thoughts on opening 20 right now space I don't mind I mean it's like well sure you know or a coffee shop next to commerce yeah I don't think they're happy but not really dude it's like you open a pizza place pretty big city open it right as grill having said that this is good I'm not going to eat five that that's super that would be an all-time scorer but it's higher than I thought it's gonna be I'm gonna go seven four and it's not really my stuff but it's good so what Jason said I think it's different when you get a commercial spot and then it just got schmoes the owner actually is in there opening and working it so Detroit style pizza very good Jason drew Oh cats go watch cast tomorrow go Google and if you're into just like wild things in nature and then watch movies so that's a review great guests eight five with shadow seven four jets pizza that's a review mushroom onion green pepper black olive and tomato yeah she said you know we have green arrows with slack valves on that so we can switch out black for greenness I don't know if I can get maybe some I don't know how to describe by keyboard everything butt cheeks you

people we don't have time to send you pizza we're too busy with this quarantine filling the shells fine at first I'm like all right that makes sense you know quarantine make up burger things in one man a pizza but there were the only [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ones every company in the world sent me their pizza I'm getting hundreds of boxes a day and then I thought about it in the time that this clown on Instagram wrote this long paragraph like we can't do it you're not that important we can't send you one pizza I'm not I'm just one man trying to entertain people and get reviews these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] could have sent me pizza they're right in this long exploit Moby Dick a thesis of why they can't send me one [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pizza well guess who sent me plenty of pizzas the people I'm getting Jack's left and right in the mail and by the way I'm getting pictures of Jack's and freezers and their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] overflow and they can't give them away there's no shortage of Jack's there's no shortage of frozen pizza these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thought they were too good for the game and I mean that with no disrespect calling a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's probably just one [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] twerp with zits all over his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] face an intern running the jack social media page who's like oh let me write this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] whoa why I can't let me write [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 10,000 words though I can't send him one [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pizza these glasses still look great on me shop Feliz gray slash Dave you can buy them but I got it Jax and I'm gonna review this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pizza and I'm gonna try to keep this on the up-and-up because I'm like straight out genero I'm not gonna be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] warped and let my score be altered by the fact that you're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no disrespect because it could be just one idiot on social media hey if you don't send me a pizza fine but don't write eight gazillion words and why you can't because I'm a can-do guy I'm a can-do I don't want to hear can't I want to hear a can or just ignore it we want to set a word if you just ignored it either they didn't get the message we'll get it from somebody else but the way the attitude the sheer disgust like how dare you do this during a quarantine I'm doing this for the people in quarantine to believe in something and you know what they don't believe in the name Jack right now but I'm not gonna let your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] social media guy no disrespect because it is a quarantine but he's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm not gonna let him all for this score I'll give you a fair run because I'm a fair [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guy so I have no grudge I'm not holding a grudge against these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we'll see what we got alright pizza review time Jack Jack Jack Jack Jack I

piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm not even making that up you that is just a weak link dip a weak limp dick and by the way that wasn't me like Rick rigging the deck there I had no part of that I don't even care I want this to be great I'm rooting for greatness I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love Jax but of all the frozen pizzas we've done the first one that just Falls like a floppy little flaccid little

be the best pizza I've ever had and I'll be fair one bite Jax Oh oh my god it's so floppy why is this picture so floppy no spine like a jellyfish Pizza Man I wanted him to be good I really did it's not horrible I don't know maybe it was though it was sent to me because maybe it didn't stay frozen or something I don't know because people had to send it to me as opposed to the professionals like everybody else because he's on that computer type in a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he says doing the theory of life in the Bible and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and hit someone pizza hmm it doesn't that bad taste to be honest it's just so floppy it just has no spine no backbone no will to succeed no will that entertained no will to give people hope and I don't know why I'm not gonna like I said I don't even care it didn't bother me that they didn't send it I could care less I'm gonna keep it fair look at this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing it looks like poop other than that that's so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] floppy it's actually not that bad I told you I was in keep it real I'm nothing else not the most honest pizza review of all time I don't let outside factors influence me I don't let the hubbub I don't let my personal opinions I don't like grudges none of that so yeah this is really floppy pizza to taste not the worst I've ever had so I'm gonna give it a very honest point zero eight that's a reveal oh I'm

on the uh coach kate duke hate cards i thought i saw him looking up yeah he was checking it out yeah we got to get that that's the little cue card is why you hate coach k we're walking around with like 30 stats on why he's the worst all right spider because they have two food trucks they have disease pizzeria and then um southern southern's which is crawfish so they only have two of them this is we're in the south so let's do let's eat some crawfish here i have no idea how to eat it spider spider i don't know how to eat these you pinch and pull you want me to show you yeah all right we're gonna get a quick tutorial from this gentleman on how to eat this thing all right what you do is you want to put the thumb here and do like a twist yep it comes out like that and if you want suck the head yep that's where like the the flavor the juices are then put that down and you want to crack it open start the cup like this like that and then it's that let me wrap this up got it all right so that's good oh that's real good yeah it does just it tastes like crab lobster hybrids suck that i'm not i'm not sucking that yeah suck that the yellow stuff you suck the yellow stuff all right that's called mustard all right i feel like now that was pretty good i feel like i'm pure [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what do they say nolan's now because i've already eaten bunch leaves but now i got it down so let's do a quick crawfish review and i've learned that man showed me how to do it so here's how you do you pull the tail you twist it like that beautifully done by me then you kind of pinch and you open you open like so so we're open and then you hold and pull hold and pull oh yeah yeah yeah i'll be over there see that okay man let's see in a bit and you get maybe point zero one ounce of meat but it's the most delightful meat you'll ever have eight three you take the head that looks like poo and goo and jerk and you just suck it down it's an eight three spiders honestly in eight three like you need two days to get through the whole bag but it's worth it that's a crawfish review bonus when in noah do nola stuff so this is we got now the bonus on top of the bonus review what is the name of this we call it a red top red top okay it looks really i can tell it's crispier just on the bottom already holding it now i'm on my third pizza view i also did a crawfish boil i've had a beer my mouth is on fire so just like athletes have to be at the top of the game and if they just played like three straight football games you may not get their best effort that's where we're at right now better absolutely night day and this pizza is a thousand times crispy why is it so much crispier is because of a single slice that old oven is a little struggle yeah new one is gonna be a lot it'll be like that every time yeah i mean this is way crispier than what i right which is huge for what i like yeah that's our bread and butter right there but i do like i mean my mouth has like the crawfish in it but i think i like if i combine the first one with this crisp that would have been my favorite but it was really really good right love that you're trying it thanks for stopping yeah just cook differently i'm not gonna score it i'm gonna put it in at the end of it roll up i already have the score i'm too confused like what a slice score i can't i won't i'm a little confused because this slice which i wasn't gonna score that i brought out after i scored is is way better than what i scored i can't rescore it he knew i was doing it i don't know he has an easier time with slices i guess re-warming them but this slice is a seven nine like maybe even an eight what that's how good this slice is different ball game with this slice crazy you can hear the crunch all the way back in boston crazy

for the last hundred years that that is what a tavern like bartender wager should look like prototypical by the book cool thank you so much it was so fun seeing you guys here call me a snob pizza snob pizza stop well i mean it in a good way there's some pizza snob here i knew when your mouth was covered that you called me a snog some pizza slobs here so what is this all right casey's pork roll which is based right here in trenton and spicy mustard that's crazy the spicy mustard but you tell me to do it we'll do it guys this pizza is way crispier than the cheese a little something different we use here what does that mean we don't we don't use traditional mozzarella all right now if it's burning hot i gotta let this break and if we're being honest i would never order this a million years because i don't really like anything on my pizza nevermind pork mustard but he demanded that i do it so we're gonna take that with a grain of salt i would never order this in a million is that the mustard down here yep okay is that is buzzed throughout the whole pizza yes all right okay i gotta let cool so i don't burn my face off enjoy it how do a lot of people order this yes okay is it your number one pie my sausages it's awesome all right got it okay got it go let it cool it looks great i don't the difference in crisp between this and what i had before is like night day still too hot nothing that i want more than i don't really like mustard i've had 19 pizzas already and we're going to go with a rogue pizza here i mean i smell mustard yep well this is mustard mustard he demanded i try a mustard pork pizza mustard pizza i feel wrong about that i had the cheese already but he was adamant that people get to take something right there's no way no no try it don't smell it you can smell it kind of lady me neither but i got i don't want to say it's all the gunpoint good chef said go he he you know he didn't say he put a gun in my mouth and said you get you yeah so here you are i mean it tastes like mustard it's good it's as good as it could be like if there are two ingredients i don't like exactly what you'd expect no it's it's not overpowering but i don't like i'm like you i don't like mustard i don't want anything to do with it in fact i never eat mustard on anything and i would never put like pork on my pizza we're at uh i don't know six three i mean i i don't like it but that's because i'm bad for something i don't like i don't even put mustard on burgers dogs nothing so whatever it is what it is it is good pie i guess we like mustard all right that's a total

maybe they can hook me up yeah they got the new one too they actually brought back like the retro broncos so there you go all right let's see what we got um first before we go this i i held back harbaugh we were talking a little bit about it what do you think like if you're there if you're still playing and you're like oh i'm gonna go coach the vikings then he turns he's like just kidding i'm coming back would that bother you maybe a little bit um just as a player i i talked to all the all the dudes back in michigan and they had no idea what he was doing right so um like i didn't like michigan's twitter account was like he's back it's great i was like i don't have a party partying it's like it felt like he was ready to go and now he's back hey i know i know all those guys are glad he's back though so you know and by the way we have him largely responsible for those cowards at ohio state who have been in my mention you they cried more than any group of people it was a great world it was amazing for 20 years they're like chirp chirp chirp we beat them by a hundred and they won't shut up spider but the thing is though it was a beat down it was a pizza that physical you have that clip of you taking their alignment and they're like throwing them a hundred years that's right yeah that was on rewind and they just cry they'll cry about anything it's crazy it's crazy um all right so this actually doesn't look horrible okay somebody walked by and it's like it's trash it's like give us a chance so take a slice 0-10 what's your favorite pizza in an upper uh that's a neopopulus okay i gave that a low seven you did yeah it's it's all right that's ann arbor's have the best that's the apollo in this style yeah right that's not generally my favorite little too much flop there is a decent amount of thought that doesn't want to fly by the way he grew up 20 minutes outside of ann arbor so michigan go to the lions and this is off the record for all you detroit people i'm like what do you think of going to lions it's like it would be pretty cool to stay home and then be good so that's a truthful statement if you trashed him i would have kept it up myself that's right that's right i'd love to win in 100 years that's wrong all right so one bite you know how to score it this is not trapped i don't know what that guy was saying do you like joe's in ann arbor that's not good yeah josh that's really good that's a chain but yeah really good what do you think by the way at the heisman one desmond there's a mockery of that guy you know the main mission was to come back was to beat ohio state and win a big ten championship and uh hey kenny i'm glad you're in between it's good and you know we stay there better than his offensive lineman well we made a mockery of them it was a little bit awkward standing up there but i was loving it though i was looking and you see you look on social media after and you see how he was so mad at his face oh my god yeah i didn't like that i'm sure i don't think ryan did like that either well ryan dave was born on third base that's a fact give credit for harbaugh he is a fact he got great talent he hasn't done anything you guys asked what last time so no offense to the ohio people i like i'm gonna say this i like ohio people in general they're nice working hard working people yeah the school is institutional chaos that's fine that's what it is don't forget he also said he was gonna hang a hundred on us he did don't forget that i didn't i didn't forget it no you didn't i did not forget that i love it it's so good to be on the other side of this and again ohio people are gonna be like you know you haven't won when i went to school brady's here you guys didn't win for 100 so now you probably won't win for another 100 years all right i'm gonna go i'm gonna go six seven professional score that's six seven professional score very i would say it's a very average piece of piece of pie you know that's a good that's a fair do you like the detroit style is that like is that your jam it's i i like i like more this style but like thinner but um it's it's very average pizza pizza i would say i'm those six eight i went a little higher than him i've been scoring a little lighter so i could it's pretty decent the way people were talking about i thought it was gonna be worse it's actually a pretty decent pie it's actually a football style too pretty traditional so not bad about his house not bad at all ayden hutchinson restored us back to glory this guy's walking by asking me if i um ted seriously if we should sell his house what do you think of peter schiff and what peter ship says about like bitcoin no no i think he's like an anti-basically anti-bitcoin yeah yeah do you think like zamora since you think so i know so well like what's tangible about the bitcoin like money but isn't it like in a sense like a ponzi scheme like you only get your money from the next person no no they it's a fix there's only a fixed amount of it no i understand the 21 million yeah right but what can you actually do with it like go to miami you know clubs or restaurants it's currency but how is it occurrence if it's as volatile as it is you know right now you have you're saying stock market's not volatile it is but we're saying like gold isn't that volatile if you see it's kind of what but what is aerospace it's in technology our phones you really think that's the value of gold utility and the mining of it you know there's there's also a limited amount of gold and you're wearing gold aren't you this it's not gold no it is it's yellow it's you know we use it as jewelry yeah but if you just said you're going to make copper what's the difference it just had like it it was an old thing so you think bitcoin is going to go to 100 000 like should i buy some because i bought some yeah i bought it i bought it 36 thousand so it's at like 44 right now yeah there's definitely a gambling part of it but i mean so is every currency it's like it's i i was skeptical in the beginning but it's so i know that's why you know i saw when it was like 800 like nine years ago i actually took my money out of the market and i bought a house in palmdale there you go but it really hasn't been that good because i get like 20. what's going on i finally made it a month yeah but i used all buy this whole thing so do you think maybe it would be a good idea to sell the house well i'm not like i i i'm not going to tell you inside your house no no i don't live in it i'm just renting into a military guy so i was just wondering like if you had cash that you want to sell your house yeah i'd buy bitcoin okay buy penn stock i'd buy that for bitcoin you figure out if you're gonna sell that house yet so i mean you know what honestly when he moves because i found that every single applicant was like low credit it's not really the best area that rent homes out to people so i think i'm either going to sell it or put like a line of credit cause like and then maybe just going to the dividend place i think oh bitcoin favorite stone temple pilot song what was that favorite stone double pilot size i don't know who that is that's a review that's a review come on yeah take care of yourself all right see ya thank you thank you aidan good luck by the way with everything and uh thank you thanks for bringing back michigan i'll be on the record i said i wanted harbaugh fired and i said football was dead to me until they beat ohio state so he he brought football back i was calling it a basketball school i saw it i was pretty pissed at you yeah well you were someone had to like but now we're here i know we're here well but if you're a michigan guy you shouldn't have accepted like tryhard like michigan is a premier program we have to act that way you're right 100 all right there it is that's a review

all those pizzas you don't like the taste of it Jason eat something obscene like the guy's got a good brain this tastes like strong brain a pizza that you would get if you went to a hockey rink and not none arena two hockey rink where kids play and they saw a slice of pizza this is not good that's bad in the second they like this 7-eleven when you buy a piece of meat the cylinder comes that little glass case but I know exactly what you mean for the warmer on it and ain't forgot that which is probably the most insulting just ditch the place we never have said about them but it's not bad it's just stop there's nothing to it I think it's not a taste that I would describe as bad I'm honestly bad it was the same average it's an average piece of meat to score then zero to ten well average I'll give it a five okay I think that's actually a pretty good tour for this pretty fair I'm going all the way down 3.6 Frankie I found this Pizza disgusting it's disgusting you might want to give it

angel they don't know that and that's that's the beauty that's it'll live and die this is a roulette wheel of pizzas that's the streets of New York when you do have a seat serve you spin the pizza where most people do take it we don't want people eating watch free pizzas God wants it you want it right I'll have a big thank you guys take the slump pay a selfie what you just want to be in the

table know what's your score on that see what you tech it's got to be we got dobby 8.4 Wow well juice Nate you spin half an eight that's her if you score didn't want it to begin with your scores eight point two eight point four no wrong but you can't just yell at them because they like it they might like this beat so they gave it an eight and an eight point two we gave it a five minute three point four obviously a reputable establishment looks like it's been all controlled a couple of years so somebody must like the beat up I think I can yell at them I think I've had two hundred and fifty pizzas day in day out this guy that score stunk this guy I would give them I think they're fine people and I appreciate their scores and that's what makes America great just like New York City we've all types of ratings all type of pizza ratings are welcome here but the statute says give me your crowd your mighty your pizza that says that on the Statue of Liberty's uh thing that she holds a crisp if somebody comes here some little kid watching at home right now is like I'm going to this place because these guys gave mid eight thats on me and I can't live without it's on him but then there jamm him because you really think that's an eight point I was trying to be alone nice not gonna lie see just did lie what is it that that's why we can't have wife then you can't change your order prepare once you say it do boom it's like it's like checkers what to make the mood you can't take it back I'm just trying to keep the pizza game on the up-and-up your sanity he's trying to keep the peace you

just want this coming all right well that's a wild review so five point one three point six eight point two or four that's not scoring any all over the mountain so oh yes so it's very very polarizing it's it's from Daniel there's always for the folks back home I would trust I would trust the Louis I take it that you're not gonna come would you do if they came over and defended their pizza and like attacked me but we should ask them what they think I'll say to you you want it only rated in his three I did before honestly when I bashed places like that I just hope they're yeah no I'm sorry I'm saying thank you sir it's amazing yeah and I would just be like I like how you just turn right like this is stupidest thinking listen I I never claimed to be like a fighter like I never claimed to be a spy see you didn't really like what would you rate the pizza 11 out of 10 that's just say he raises it 11 out of 10 thank you sir I gave him five that's not good either Chris no no I was I can I gave you one cement shoes now now we now we got to get a cab and get the hell on it hello he's coming out here just butchered think about this why if he came out and I got engaged I gave it an eight you got your nose off what we thinking don't show up if you disappear this is the last pizza reveal you that's on me yeah he's in the East River because you insulted Don Corleone's post too many people just do they know see they depend they see they not they know about obviously that way yeah watch this before we have to give real sports abiding ever saying that well you don't want to get me a meat count I just tell you what happened stand by your review I did stand by that just by god it was like that guy lied again now what did I feel like what I said this guy killed your pizza no I

to you know look heavy but feel light this slice feels like the box is heavy but we got a chance here so we were at a Brooklyn Original Pizza one of my all-time races Brooklyn square pizza right not to be compared with that Brooklyn square but yeah I think right the guy had cancer when I saw him rushing to the hospital one of my favorite guys shut up that guy by the way picked what a day to come today was in the freaking hospital I'm battling that Hodgkin's little phone ran from the hospital yeah I was on my way back yeah I was there all morning the report is good yesterday that's good to know [Applause] it's good it's fresh I'm not seeing a top 20 piece of pizza places though in Jersey it's good I'm hungry foreign I mean it's good like I would never complain about it but we're driving back from Philadelphia to uh New York City We're Gonna See Molly the meatball hopefully she won three to one dog by the time this airs I love them all hey Molly win a lose I love you but let's kick this girl's ass today if I win or lose I love you but we're driving all over look the best of the best so I was a little surprised 7-3 Brooklyn original Pizzeria there it is that's a review another pie why because you got the wrong way we wanted to try the Brooklyn how do you order the wrong one no no no I'm saying yeah I know we gotta go we got a we got a round one for you I'll paint them if I want you this is your go-to slice and this isn't the best one you see that's the resistance yeah he's known for the square who's known for the squares uh the owner so then what and this is the squares yeah well now I'm confused now I'm confused so we're known for the switch but if you want it around we can make it around so they're making you around right now no I don't want I want what you guys are known for that's one of them you got to try that one too it does stay home for the squares on the website yeah so why am I eating around yes so you think they should take that off the window then hold me that's the kind I like so I don't know squares are for certain things you're the name of the place is the home of I mean on the T-shirt it says home with the squares you can't then be like this around you know I'm saying yes yes but you have to try I mean all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is good all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at first but that I mean you cannot not try it around because this is like that pizza right there is like nobody makes it around then it should say the home of the circles yes you get what I'm saying we call in it says Square so obviously we go with what we think your signature things this signature is the Brooklyn noise all right okay thank you okay if I was gonna die and add one slice to eat which one should I be using a broken really that's my no I'm not saying nothing I'm not saying nothing all right we got all sorts of confusion going on we did the review I got mad at you because we got a square pie but it does say home of the square so I like how you not gonna get squares but then they're saying this is their Brooklyn one guy's like you're gonna try the circle I asked two people excuse me if you're gonna die what slice would you eat and then everyone gave different reviews this may gone on me we'll start with the Brooklyn which some people are saying is their signature well plate gone plate gone man down a little bit windy so we'll start with Brooklyn this one is crispy soup almost like Detroit style how they did the sauce there I think it's very similar to the first one I have same now we'll go with the round I don't think there's much I kind of like they're both same Texas light and fluffy go down the garage miss my mouth I don't know what he was talking about in there that nobody else said this is just a traditional cheese slice I'm gonna stick with the square I don't I'm confused on what all the hype I mean it's good but it it I think he said we're the only one who do a round pie it's basically we said that's not true um so we're gonna stick with the original review I think it's very good quality light squares I would go Square here seven three stick with the original um and I don't see a huge difference between the Brooklyn and the traditional Square to be totally honest so it got a little convoluted there we go that's a review oh and green death is that a girl soccer team yeah my daughters that's like the

ludlow so here's a new here's the thing we called this and they've been sitting for a second this guy i was talking as him and his son been doing it for four years i think he's gonna pop out he's very nervous he's like everyone bust my balls you've never shown up it had a great score in the app i they do 10 different styles they do like grandma sicilian they ask you do you want new haven crosstalk new york crust i said do you know anything about me do you know how i rolled you know i live new haven crust duh um we'll go in there get some b-roll so here we go one bite everybody knows the rules uh casa pizza this is what they are calling a new haven cross i don't see it totally um like i don't see it totally because i don't think that new haven has that like red on the bottom i don't think [Music] this is good but it doesn't remind me of new haven at all not even a little bit it's a good thing crafty pizza i know the owner's gonna come out he's coming out right now so seven seven seven seven um you're right look there he is right here yeah it was you and your son right yeah me and my son four hours a day so how long have you been here this is our fifth year in business this month you know so let's go inside we'll show um and we'll get it this is great i didn't totally remind me i knew it no no we're waving i feel like doesn't have like what is it what are you guys dripping all over yeah if i knew it was you i wouldn't put the parm on i put a little bit of farm a little bit of garlic because but we wanted how people normally have it so like we don't ask where it's special but a new haven doesn't generally put the new that's probably what i was thinking was a little different or the cornmeal stuff on the back right that's yeah we put a little more cornmeal on it to give it a little more crunch yep but um this is like more artisanal in a way it's very good crust is what we are trying to replicate the toppings more is like a special treat for us because we do ten styles right we do like the bostonian like centaur fields where it's upside down yep we do the new york we're spin with a puffy edge we got even a montenarro like in new york at keste so oh yeah the castle that's across from johnsonville that's cal state's more like almost neapolitan style i don't know how you do all right grandma we do them off what's that you gotta watch a review what am i gonna get so let's get the inside what's the number one pizza that uh people order from you like if they order the new haven like crazy because nobody makes a thin crust around here so we try not to try not to we can't make it exactly like new haven because they they get scared of the burn you know but we put the pitchers on the wall to explain it so you guys even do a full deep dish yeah chicago i was going to play with you i would be like well you have to give us 10 scores because we all do 10 thousand pizzas crazy to do that many and that's why we wanted to do something special we go to all the shows and you know we're trying to you know create something like we do the half calzone pizza yup you know which is for the show it's more like we do the garlic not crusted if you ever worry though it's like if you do them all you can't specialize in one if you're doing like like if people think what are you guys known for i guess you're known for this but doing all this is what we're known for rather than coming in and trying our pizza you're only trying one pizza but we try to help them find what they want yeah and i just i love all these styles but you can't get them around here yeah yeah so you know i said me and him got to do this thing and man it worked we won the best of in 2018 with just the new york style yep and that's great those customers have been driving that's crazy i can't believe you're in here i can't believe it's hard all that much i was for the celtics and i figured i'd we just went and found all the spots we haven't had so i do appreciate it very much i really paid for the journey no no it's i'm confident i don't care what the score is it's like a blessing that you came in i appreciate it thank you very much yeah of course let me get that oh i didn't even see it yeah you're a big fan [Music] i would love to get a picture of me and my son of course you can i know i just didn't i didn't know who's awesome is that awesome yeah we don't do you

review I think first or second I don't remember what I got it we have Sal's who I gave a nine and she gave a five so this is a major pizza two terms all right so one bite everybody knows the rules hi Chet yo your of terrible pizza I really want to put the speech on your face like every bone in my body just once there I'm gonna stalk the world hear me drop the world with an eight-point-two Salas is better is better 8.2 I just shocked the world I just shocked the world I'm gonna get mr. seven everything you think that's two points higher than selves lega buyer to have this first house would have been better okay and she loses all Pizza credibility right there you can't judge excuse me what if our figure skating you just said you know it means that what you do first exactly exactly that's exactly what I said home so that's exactly so you set the bar at a five that's like a great score so now you're gonna judge that being after a five so element is the five well that's a major problem if it sells is a five you have to judge that based on fine here's the thing we're going after that at tasty burger that was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so now the taste of my mouth was nasty burger and I'm eating this and I'm like this is heaven compared to what I just ate no tons of burden yeah but it's still in my mouth like the flavors are still there the experience still stick away that thing because the feature of use should be a feature here I feel like my size in my largeness makes me what makes me the champion pitcher here just I've reviewed every [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] place in New England

that race walking is the we're if they got so we're gonna have a race walk off that probably like a two-to-one favorite she's five to one I think I'm gonna beat you race well that's complete [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you don't even know how to raise well you know one of the rules yeah you will have judges well you've got a show are you on me or her doing the rules so both feet have to be down at one point in time so they can't ever be at least one photo please that's what weeks ago one two I'm almost positive as we didn't replay in my hands first one across the tape the new in fit that you just be no Olympic athlete yeah I know that that was uh you got beaten sticking a hand up every race in the history of races it's who crosses the Tagus what I don't there's no tape and I do not race there's also a setting that's all I do there is a hundred percent there was no team so the taste of Fenway continues the best sausage company not the sausage king which I think most people would say is the sausage you want to get but we we didn't he wasn't it's not a game day not open I don't like sausages so that's going to affect the score but it was Holly's choice so here we go and so a blood-red and now give us zero I don't like coffee if it's not the sausage wall I maybe it is I don't like you did too hmm I like sausage what are you gonna do did you score I'm giving you the moments in my hands on my body oh god you're a high-maintenance and you like soft that's a three from mangled it's more bread than anything zero for me think you combined sport 1.5 okay not not the best for the best sausage company so we've seen this person take a picture you yep all right not the best everyone sausage all right so then he did the taste of Fenway hey well you have to be in the Olympics

uncomfortable about it because you can probably get any girl you want yeah and you're like everything a dick exactly so he complains about it I mean it's not I mean it's still what it's just think Kate Upton the other day was complaining because yeah it's like shut up so that's what my problem yeah boy yeah boy he's pretty good at anything - nobody wants real yeah I think I'm aware of it but

do it you went to the bathroom i started the process never seen anything like it so come on in so walk in i already got a beer obviously clearly so you order a drink and she asks like you want a pizza with that it's like yeah that's why we're here and then up on the top so see the the bar pizza thing there each topping's one dollar i'm a cheese guy so it's free so you buy beer get a ticket then you take the ticket and go to the pizza line free pizza so one beer i don't even know i i think this i didn't even pay attention it was three or four bucks it was nothing unusual maybe even less and now we wait to redeem our ticket for our free pizza now i asked i'm like what happens if this place is packed and busy and they just said a line forms and i don't know how long so here we go can i redeem that pizza now does everyone just tip like they bought a pizza basically do they they do so they they'll put in like yeah but does everyone do it most people do or don't oh cause they're drunk so they get free pizza they don't break so how long do the peas i don't understand wouldn't it be like if how long does this [Music] yeah that that to me if you got a full bar it's a dollar per topping that's crazy i just logistically like i don't even necessarily i'm screwing you guys because i got like three bucks yeah that's why i'm broke but i don't [Music] how can people wait if there's ten people in line so they're waiting for ten times tens an hour and 40 minutes for pizza no no the lion moves so fast we have three four clips oh you do so you could use so like they're constantly popping out all right yeah yeah okay so there's multiple lines back yeah what what's crazy my boss is in the business is this was recommended to us as a pizza place not as like a bar we tried to call this in just like well you are but you're not like we offer free pizza so but we tried to call in to buy a pizza like you can't you probably thought it was a prank no no they're like you can't it's like you only get a piece if you buy a drink all right yep but i know that's crazy yeah so what if i look at this guy's shirt [Music] show down uh the sit down jeff nadew uh tommy cheese balls myself kirk manahan and regal bosco we have a sit down with the five fathers of dj i'm so curious to see how good it is all right we'll wait we'll find out what a setup spider [Music] all right spider so i don't know how we're gonna do this review i don't even know if i can bring a beer out here um i gave the background already the only way to get a pizza at johnny max which is crazy i've never seen anything like it is you gotta go in order a drink you get a ticket ticket you get a free pie you go give the ticket to the guy i explained the whole thing we'll cut that in so here it is probably took 10 minutes this is a small little like bar looking pizza so we'll see what we got i don't want to burn my face imagine being like hammering these every time i got a drink i'd feel compelled to get a pizza like compelled good on the carriage and here's the thing you'd think this pizza wouldn't be good by just the nature of what they're doing but everybody in there is like no it's pretty good and we have lots of people recommend to be like go try johnny max makes no sense it's an irish place serving italian pizza that you need a beer nothing adds up except they say it's good we'll see i don't burn my face it just came out of the oven here we go strong sauce imagine like being drunk and just making out like pizza breath in there that must happen all the time you mean like make out with a girl be like i don't like her she has bad breath no she's just been eating pizza for free all night i like it but you can't it it's more what i'd expect and it's not like i mean you're not getting rosie's and you're not getting vicks it's good pizza i'm gonna go three more pizzas it's free bar pizza a new category that we've never had it's the first ever category of free bar pizza so everyone at home this is where it gets weird because other pizza places who only do pizza can be like how'd you get this is a new category it's free buy a coors light bud light whatever margarita get a free pizza keep that in mind and go six six nice that's a special category though i don't want to hear the blue birds from places like hey i've been doing pizza for 100 years we charged 20 bucks that's all we do we gave up this is a new category this is free buy drink get a pizza category 66 as far as i know the only category or one of its kind in the world so i like it i think it's a very cool like little gimmick thing

the crust is boosting it i take the gnome bite i'm like okay i got where it is and i take the crust i like to crust so much it's changing my mind i'm gonna eat three eight three solid solid pizza i think eight three is the right score i think eight three is the right score i'm proud of that story i stick by it you almost get this guy on uh camry's such a character that's when he wants to be on there but this guy this guy's the real deal if i was just voting on him i'd give it like a nine-nine like i love the guy eight three solid score very good pizza um and another big famous one off the list santillo's elizabeth jersey it's a review how long how long have you been doing it one man shop here's the deal my grandfather started this business in 1918. my father started over here in 1957. i've been working here since i was old enough to stand up i grew up in this house still living here i'm 62. and what's your hour situation whenever you feel like close right now i'm open thursday friday saturday and sunday 11 to 9. but i pretty stay faithful to those hours but the i built the business around my life that's how my father said the business is built around our life so if i got a close for something there's no there's not another guy in the world that could come over here and you see what i do over here with this oven there's another guy in the world right now that could come and do what i do put these pies in here turn them all around twist them all around oven yes and every everything that you see here go take a close-up in there everything that you see here is all done by eye you got to be taught by a master my like the people that taught me were masters see how you look at that yeah you gotta know by eye how it's supposed to look i'm glad that you stopped then i'm proud to tell everybody but i'm the last of a dying breed if my father was supposed to be the last and then i says he got sick when he was like 57 he couldn't work no more then it's like either i'm going to take this thing i know how hard it was or else it's going to this good kind of piece is going to be extinct who else what other pizza places do you respect in like new york new jersey area there's there's not this there's this pizza and then there's everybody else but who's got a good pizza like in this league that's hard for me to say i like it i'm telling you no i'm telling you the truth you could bring me anybody's pizza here and i can tell you what they're doing wrong yeah because this was handed down father to some for three generations by the guys that knew what they're really doing you understand this is a craft this is a trade this is not something that you're going to grab a guy off the street and in five minutes they throw the guy in front of the oven i'm sure everywhere you go well you see a lot of that yeah so whoever they can get and then the boss walks around he's the boss now that this is the real italian way how it was when they came here 100 years like squeeze that that that's why i'm here love it because if my father says if you can't make a good loaf of bread what the hell good are you i'm going to take this really good aged pecorino romano cheese that once you buy it you can't use it the way they give it to you you got to buy the good stuff from italy but this only aged so long you got to age it longer the longer you age this they could age this up to three years this is listen i'm gonna tell you something turn that off for a second secrets give you a line when the real italians come in here i'm gonna teach you how to say it so you feel it you walk in you see the stuff that i'm making this is the real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guinea [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] given to me i can say that yeah i'm a jewish guy i can still say it you no this is the real guinea [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] give it up there's the real he's a real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guinea [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] giving me that's how you say it all right i'm doing that from that right now it's a real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guinea [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] give it to me done i'm doing that from [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now on everywhere i go that's the time this is a real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guinea [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] give it to me all right you could say it all right you got to watch the ride all right you're going to hear that i put your blood into all right as long as i listen i everyone heard it i just got blessed to say give me the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] side i'm 100 italian and it's like he had a book old old rules go through the book go to the book if he could find something that was harder or longer tougher way to do it that's the way we're going to do it i love it i love it give me the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kidney [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's no i'll say it well you gotta say just like this you got the real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guinea [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] give it to me you got the real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gift [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] give it to me you don't believe this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when i was 13 years old you see that bread yup i used to put 163 loaves of bread in that oven it was insane and you know what my father taught me and then he left me here by myself to practice and try practice and try and if i screwed it up i had to make it over explain it to the customer that's that's how you get the real deal as you get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guinea [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i was taught audio of the italian ways and all the like little italian shopkeepers it was great you went today you went to the towers you went to centennials you went to kalamoosa it was wonderful when you went and saw the happy italian people that you know like gave us like a little thrill what do you think the new haven pizza been there like sally's pepe is modern the only one i have was pepe's and i'm going to tell you he makes a good pie but i got issues with it was like a discussion with you off the record i mean everyone has their opinions sally's i like more than pepe yeah i never had sally's i think you'd like sally sally's is more like all i could tell you is i never had sally's but i sent one of my intelligences up there and i got two videos i could show you of a guy that worked for my dad doing those that went up there and investigated that's called we do our we're italians we do our own dirty work i these guys all these guys talk about pizza i don't think he knows anything about people well i know i don't know i know about what i want to say that's pretty good for like the first time i can't complain you got the job done so this is like that's kind of hot to be eating but you know it's good for golfer electric garlic bread you want you want me to give you a demonstration how i cleaned the oven this is like the most ancient thing you see over here now look i figured out a way to do all this oh my father taught me this you see this this right here this old pair of pants tied onto the stick but i have people here i don't know how many times i tried to teach them how to do this and they can't do it don't like this you must be like in good shape yeah it's like working out listen this is like all the guys i had that work for me the gym rats they used to love this because this is like you know a

311,"Barstool Pizza Review - Giuseppina's (Brooklyn, NY)",RYqzz8ac7tg, yes [Music] okay uh pizza review time shame on you austin not knowing park slope when you googled the thing you didn't notice we're in park slope corner of 6th and 20th we are still in brooklyn uh giuseppes gizapinas so is this the one that the guy yelled at us at little luke's and he's like my dad owns it right poor godfather i thought he says dad on it [Music] oh there you go all right i was wondering why um smells good looks good brick oven i think they only serve pizzas in there by looking at the menu but it's like sit down and romantic like to have wines and stuff so i bet it gets pretty busy uh i you know i saw them take it out of the oven and sometimes it happens if you beat them it looked like maybe it came out of the oven like a second too quick but i'll see if i can open the box so there it is maybe that is how they take it out it looks like maybe leave it in there for a minute more maybe a couple minutes more but again i'm waiting for the pizza there's no one in there so they're doing it um one bite everyone knows the rules this is like a lucali crust it's super light crust it's also a million degrees so i'm just going to talk make conversations i'd have burned my face off because i did burn the roof of my mouth on the last review and i'm injured i'm playing hurt but that's what we do so uh just a penis yeah i know at that time just a penis one bite ever knows the rules so this feels like lacali not the slice shop the other one where it kind of looks like it may be heavy but it's super light and airy which again not to keep repeating myself lukali was like a top 10 spot for me in the world ironically we just did luigi's which i also would say is a top 10 spot in the world for pizza so we're on a great pizza tour right now one bite i'm in those rules i'm still a little nervous about the top of my mouth uh see if that does anything see what we got [Music] oh the parmesan that they have on this has some kick on it oh wow interesting okay the pizza is great they're using there's some connection and i don't know if my mind would have put together with jitsupinas nailed it right and luke holly like they both have that same kind of look heavy but super light which i love the parmesan is not my favorite thing and if i knew if i was coming here knowing just as a civilian i would have been like no parmesan please because it has a strong kick to it that you can either like or not like however you can tell it's great pizza [Music] oh wow the parmesan and all garlic it's strong i don't know how to score this i honestly don't score this because i know it's great but it's strong like i i can't even tell with parmesan like these chips right here i don't even know if that was it be totally honest yeah it's strong um what i'm doing in my head it's like what do you give it because you know it's great but it's not your type of grade with the exception everything out if you take that kick out i'm gonna go eat one i owe you one i think if it was straight cheap if it didn't have a super strong thing that this could be a high eight low nine that's how good it is and i think if i reordered it to my liking you'll go there but i just give what you give she asked me if i'm pajama i'm like do whatever you normally do and that's what they gave me eight one it's a great pizza i'd highly encourage it but no it can have kick if you're doing the garlic and the parmesan i think i think it's parmesan i think that's what it is um that's this is great eight one could have been higher mixed and melded but hopefully you get the drift that's a review so this is my husband max and she does a lot of like pizza pizza pop-up and stuff like that yes i've been forced and beginning in the beginning it was forced before to watch your show like so many times but then now i like it you know what it means like i'm always cracking up so i was just walking by and i was like i called him i'm like you will never guess what if i step outside i can't believe i hadn't had luigi before like i i even adam sandler has been there i know i saw him got you a sticker for my pop-up what doe all right what up though what what does this mean it's a it's a play on where it's like our favorite dj he always says what up though got it all right so it's done yeah i like so is it a pizza place i do a pizza pop-up every now and then oh not from my apartment oh that's cool neapolitan so i know you're out here yeah i have an uni so what do you do how do you like give it away or sell it or whatever i post on instagram yeah saying that i'm having a pop-up this saturday for example yeah and i put the menu on there yup and then people put in their orders they'll send me like a message and they'll come by and pick it up and they pay me and pick oh wow okay it's fun let me know if you have an email right neapolitan is not my favorite yeah he got he won an unique certificate so now he's getting a bigger one and so we can probably make new york south carolina i mean some people love them i just don't it's like i mean personally not like barbie right totally i mean my preference is new york

316,Barstool Pizza Review - Angelo Bellini Pizzeria With Special Guest Jon Taffer of Bar Resuce,yIZL8aSBjEc, [Music] all right Frankie you know what we do here one bite we try them all every pizza place in Manhattan we have a special guest Jon Taffer some may recognize him from bar rescue while others may recognize him from blog rescue when he came back saved the block by the way some may say your blog rescue it was perfectly with our ascent to the blog world you gave us a little ice you said no more Bieber yeah and then next thing you know we're the top of the world they made happen doing this stuff but you also blew the burger that you had an agenda if we pull that up you're against me from the second I walked in my new burger yeah yeah come on just one bite everyone knows the rules heavy traffic area so I bet after that experience you do make a better burger I make I always make it your thing was you didn't like how he touched the meat with my hands but my burgos spectac actually burger was good okay my drink my drink was perfect you went on the drink and the drink is probably being served in your places now I could tell by the look that you're gonna take that recipe that i stoled it from yeah hold on I'm not opening here you open a box what do you think of a pizza company that prints their box like this I hate it I hate it tacky it should come in a regular brown pizza box so right out of the gate I'm more concerned that they're focused on marketing than quality of cheese and product agree.i yesterday's pizza filled the same exact thing happened it was a lady straight from Italy she was nineteen eighty-three I said this box stinks I said it to her face and she agreed would you lighten that design all right that's great Keita this does not read your pizza jumping she wanted the white clear inside but I agree this looks like this is a dollar slice coming from 7-eleven I almost think that they took the money out of the pizza and put it in a box I listen that's great minds think alike Frankie did I say that yesterday they don't a key box is this a pizza or billboard - you like that exactly what I was saying yesterday this is why great minds think alike okay let's not open yet what do you think I see like that smell it's got a great smell kid that's a great smell - okay so I smell everybody now we anticipated even more with you I was not expecting it to look like that that Anthony's kind of look that's a thin I don't know what that is very thin it's a little dry looking isn't it very dry around there very drying around the edges this by the way is a professional or a beautiful Jon Taffer right the cheese doesn't show to have a lot of grease in it which tells me it's very much a very dairy cheese that it doesn't have greases or oils in it so my guess is we're looking at a quality cheese also the way it Brown tells me it's a quality cheese so the other thing I see in this to see the color the sauce yep that is a raw sauce as speeches it'd be you don't want to cook sauce in the pizza what worries me is the dough doesn't it seem like it was done by a machine I won't know if it was a machine or not it looks it I don't know how to describe it looks a little perfect I think there is a lack of sauce around the like it gets super dry around the front leg look at that that's deep oh oh on the wrapper so they're tossing so it is homemade then yep it's a question/answer sauce cheese on top cheese sauce on top I like both ways I didn't know either way this is this is sauce on top I find that a lot of times the cold fire which is my favorite has the sauce on top mm-hmm I'm a huge coal fire guy the biggest just cheese what will Brown and get the blackness from the coal a little one I tend to be with you it depends upon the oven that they use so this was a wood oven yeah so we should get some wood flavor from this nice taking the first bite well we do it simultaneously it's just one bite everybody knows rules so you go zero to 10 score on one bite no flaw I like when there's no New York cloth yep oh and you do that you do the cross there now that's because it's a honeycomb this air bubbles in that crust that hunting it'll shape if they rolled the dough they would get all the air out of it and it would fly so the air bubbles in our U is what gives us that structure no I'm purposely I think if you have ya know this this one this is very good yesterday a lot of the New York slices of this plop rights are browning okay so you actually gonna eat that without folding it you have something you're gonna do that Oh try one bite every knows rules this is dry you can see it doesn't have the bubbling on the dough right into it I haven't lose a little moisture trip' so now we do now now it's the moneymaker give it your took your one bite give us what 0 through 10 then it lives on and infamy forever just can make a break do you make a break places in to make a break into a point it isn't awful I've had worse it's certainly not an airport beaten it's certainly not a foodservice Pizza which I would give me now a three or four - I'm gonna give it a 5.7 it's an unbelievable story this is one of the most professional reviews you've ever happened so what was your score five point seven so you agree oh how could I not agree with that review okay so this is a concurrence out of five point seven is this the first time that there's been a concurrence it's the first concurrence in the history the beats are based so this is historic [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ray this is as historic as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that is as historic as it gets a double five point seven but I'm gonna be honest John you blew me away with your terminology you could have said fourteen point two and I was following you I bought I bought you the end of the moon after that we did that was a review that was a perk and we've had peanut worked eyes with it that that was the best review we've had so I got lucky no I don't want to get lucky only you got lucky at all pizza review five point four that put that in as a Hall of Fame review of a pizza five points five point seven five point seven and there it is a concurrence first time in history put it in the books Frankie doctor reveal the good thing about a five point seven because it is good enough to eat let's go finish this up and pizza by the way it beats is like sex even given bath got more yeah let's go finish this sorry let's do it

review all right pizza review time um people who know barstool and know what i like the office is my absolute favorite bar non-tv show of all time so anytime i get kevin malone and i was thinking walking out i've had to repeat your real name in my head over and over and over because he's kevin luck he's always going to be kevin belong to me the brian ball gunner pizza review time who lives in l.a this place just opened b-side pizza um i have not had it neither but okay i never have any pizza places new that we try so we get a real score 0 through 10. um and now you got you you did the office podcast the deep dive in yes and now you have a new one coming out it's still going to be on office no but not at all we're going to keep talking to people in the office but now we're going to talk to everybody allison hannigan yep uh cedric the entertainer we got coming up so anthony anderson so you talk about cedric the entertainer about the office or anything no i what i'm interested in are well like your shows i'm looking for not the big moments yep i'm looking for the moments that helped shape the people and the television shows that we all love yep from early on okay so that one is it off the beat but when does it come out next week first one first one so there we go there's the perfect reason to be doing this and we waited for the pizza we're gonna put in the b-roll i just started going down a rabbit hole of talking office my favorite kevin malone lines and there's so many of them but i think i don't even know the hawley when he thought you can't we were saying can you make this show the hawley when he thought kevin was the r word slow slow kevin's like do you want an eminem and holly when she thought you're the r word you can't like you can't do that anymore i know and i always reference it it was to me probably my favorite storyline and also like in the history of network television it's a joke of a set up for four years right yeah i don't know i've never been a joke for four years you know the way the characters played how everything is and then we're gonna introduce this joke now that's what i love about it and i don't know if they're how much improvisation there is but even like that scene every i tend to like the funniest lines like premiere the little ones like after that you're like you want eminem what do you do i do the numbers oh good for you do you wanna eminem that and when pam is giving a speech now everybody my mother is coming to the office so everybody's no i just wanted to say that just my mom's coming in today [Music] i don't think i can say that though anymore can i dad milf you can say milk i think you can say it i i who knows it's another debate could you make the office nowadays do do you think you could i don't know if you answered that i think i think that we could it wouldn't be the same well then that's not the office that's true but i think we would have more fun potentially making fun of no you have the wolf people as well maybe like there's that scene i think it's uh i don't know what it is there i don't know what character somebody comes in you can still take advice and um there's a guy wearing a turban he walks michael scott goes not a terrorist oh come on that guy he is a good guy not a terrorist you just can't say that anymore no you can't say that but that was a legitimate scene like and i still watch it so it'll be on the background i'll catch you like whoa what did he just say but it that was a scene in the office it would be difficult to make it today yes it would be difficult um so here we go you take one bite zero through ten obviously if you can tell i'm super excited i mean so they all listen i of all of the pizza review shows yours is my favorite thank you you know any of those no exactly one bite everyone knows the rules that's also true this is actually pretty good good undercarriage not a lot of flop i learned that from you so it's true you don't want flop [Music] yeah so you score it zero to ten by the way here's a question if you didn't play i thought you just ran a spot if you didn't play kevin long what would have been your second choice character play dwight is an amazing character it's just an amazing character but could anyone do that but rain but all right once you watch the show like i couldn't make sure everybody's doing you but you or or rain but dwight or kelly kapoor all of them right that's what makes the office the office every single character like nobody would surprise me some say andy bars my favorite everyone just they all that's why it's to me the perfect show except and we had a little bit of beef i thought the show went downhill at the end he looked like he was gonna punch me when i said no it's my favorite show of all time but for me like basically once jim and pam got married the show was kind of dead to me like that really yeah yeah for the most part so you watched it for jim and pam no i watch it for all but like the new characters that came in like michael was still there a little bit but like once i thought it just got a little bit weird at the end you have to know it went downhill towards the end right or do you know is that breaking news for you listen no i've heard all the i thought yeah the last two years that looked like i liked that you saw a ghost when i said well underrated the last season is underrated season is underrated you should i am gonna actually on the new podcast i'm speaking of people who can't play eric stonestreet coming up eric stonestreet was the final three for kevin malone nope hitting erickson modern family oh okay yeah that makes sense kind of build the same physical appearance a little bit this is pretty good we've got more than one bike we have the guest always goes freshman oh with the rating do i put it in my own scale or like where i know you kind of will put it no your world's good what do you well you know um what's that you know i'm gonna score this yeah i'm gonna call it a seven two i'm gonna call it a seven two very solid um maybe a little too crunch no such thing i absolutely cannot believe this beside pizza this is the hotel that we basically rented for a super bowl week i haven't had it once we've been driving around i think this is actually pretty good pizza like really good i'm going seven six on this seven two that's the classics yeah look that's every little decimal point matters everything like it's gotten so tight the difference between seven two and seven six is gigantic this is some of the best pizza i've had in this general area super crispy well done i'm surprised b-side pizza sneaky really good you said it spider you're like it is good it is very good it's very good let's see it's a little it's do you take it insulting if i if i just ended up saying kevin alone as opposed to brian like you hear some people like i don't want to be just known as that one character it just is inevitable yeah well i think it's good i play i play a lot of golf yeah i'll play with guys who i play with once a week and after about 12 holes on an occasional day they'll be like good shot kev yeah it is let's take it brian baumgartener kevin malone all-time review uh i don't know all the time well yeah the the office is my number one show of all time so there you go and by the way i credited it to ricky gervais we had a little dude to do about that too the way that greg daniels was created how he tied up wait is he the creator the american version of the office because i'm also like a giant rookie for baseball me too oh someone was a huge fan so when somebody says creator i i go to him okay i think that's fair but technically okay the british version yeah let's see here's how i view it the british version is genius yeah it's a mini series yeah it's now it's like today a mini series that's what they do over there and it's different but he i mean i talked to him about this on my podcast not too long ago basically like what i said to him is your character can't survive right he's like from about the first episode the clock is ticking right he's got to be fired whereas you know michael redeem american television let's syndicate let's make 200 episodes like and he had a real journey so i mean in that regard it became really difficult greg daniels is a creator of the american version of the office ricky gervais is all by the way richard your face if you're out there you're on my hit list we tried to get him to my birthday party wanted a million dollars really one million i would have done it for 750. all right that's a review thank you where was the office the office filmed out here i don't know if i knew that i guess that makes sense yeah it did a pretty good job there are a couple of scenes on the roof yeah where you see palm trees when steve left yep they brought in spader yeah who by the way is a quiet genius yeah no question about that that's all right we're now we're in it and that's actor talk but he wasn't it was different it was it was different it was different for a year and there was a big uh a lot of people thought we we came from nothing right but now we've established ourselves as as viable yeah yeah big actors and the network at the time thought we needed a big gorilla they were like well steve carell is a big star we need another big star and a lot of the creatives were like no no we got this like we're good we got it right i mean no nobody was a big star when it started no none of us right no no steve included no i know season two 40 year old virgin yeah right but the final season i think is incredibly underrated so i'd have to rewatch it i really i got disconnected from it and then like i said there's i probably haven't seen all the episodes even i just kind of stopped watching i'd rather go back and watch the old ones i i don't know if steve said it do you think they could make the show now i mean there's some jokes in there that i'd get canceled for two seconds if i did verbatim how the office did it oh no i know no and i mean i to me one of my favorite favorite jokes of all time and i said it on my own podcast it was like i don't can i say this anymore but it's um michael is doing sensitivity training he's talking to oscar yeah yeah he gets the whole i will never forget stick in the room he puts the chair backwards he's like awkwardly straddling this chair like getting down in his face and asks oscar what a lesser offensive term for mexican is it's awesome like there's nothing offensive yeah yeah yeah but what's less offensive like this is really really under the radar one was um and now we're recording all of these things that i'm not supposed to say anymore is um [Music] my my joke that i think is true about that is it's like how many people are i mean it's the most watched show on television today yeah anything sc you know people talk sweet game they talk this they talk that no one is watching anything on television today more than the office so someone's gonna make it yeah right yeah i don't and it's ever i mean it is everything like i said i literally just keep watching it over and over right never stop watching i know the lines are coming and i even still as much as i've seen i feel like there'll be little lines that just pick up like i still people ready half the time too it's just another one i say hold you on half the time you're staying at the window when when um dwight and andy are like come on believe in something like if my guys are down i said believe in something all right we'll go out so we'll start it like we're starting it we'll just cut it we'll we'll cut i'll be like we already have the conversation while waiting for the pizza and that won't go

does um we're at zoni's coal fired pizza uh i asked you are we are like are we in middletown or red bank i think the answer is both red bank and middletown you get that stay on the box red bank and middletown zonies coal fire pizza one bite everybody knows the rules i don't understand i hope we get all the places around this area because we drove like an hour super nice town by the way like manhattan's such a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hole bags trash beautiful sprawling green lawns you know what it feels like spider a place that takes their uh litter league baseball like super seriously one bite everyone knows rules zonies that looks good i mean that looks [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good that looks like something that i would drive an hour to let now we called it in too early and it is when you do too early you get a little flop and that may be on me hand up foul am i getting the summer mood with like the hawaiian shirts yeah i am a little bit the weather's nice the chess hair is flowing the beach is open i don't know if we're near a beach it's a beautiful day to eat pizza good flavors 0.0 crisp and i don't know if that's because i was sitting here i think they know i'm out here what's going on the owner's on his way oh yeah is this pizza usually crispy did we leave it sitting too long i'm sure he does what well that's like 20 minutes right no bye spider that's a lie everyone says there's no chance it's five minutes there's how many three minutes three minutes time them they're lying spider it's 12 40 they said three minutes we have 18 pizza places we have to hit i'm just trying to get back for the bruins at seven o'clock they're saying three minutes to break a brand new pizza this isn't my first review that's a lie i haven't scored this it's so i think we called too early there's zero crisp to it i i'm still in a good mood it's the first one so we'll see how late it is as far as this goes i think it's an eight one on the app it's a seven two it's good taste but it's just it's so soft but again that could be our fault so what i am gonna do and this is the only time i'm going to do it today so if you watch future reviews and you're like dave's an [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i sometimes get cranky when i've been on the road for 10 hours and i have 3 000 slices and people like can you wait 45 minutes for a new pie i'm gonna wait one and oh now take the sunglasses off and i'll look up i'm gonna get some rays i'm gonna turn into a golden brown cookie we got memorial day weekend coming up i want the girls to go ah cookie i'm gonna relax this pizza seven two is that what i gave it seven i think i said seven two that's a review and we'll get this bonus pie that should be ready in one minute at this point because i've been talking to two all right ready all right spider so i'm gonna be honest here that was stunning i think it was five minutes literally to get me the second pot so credit to zoni's mo that's never happened any time someone says five minutes it's 25. so here we go here's a margarita pie um and i'm a cheese i you know i like margarita it's a little sloppy i may put the pressure on them to be like get the thing out of the oven because he's timing us but it's definitely crispy i can tell that already gotta let cool here because i'm gonna burn my face off if i don't good sauce good tang there's a bonus review the margarita is still a little floppy i guess one bite every knows the rules bonus much crispier though i mean that's the difference between hot and fresh out of the oven and sitting around is why you can't judge a pizza and deliver either because when you close a box for like five seven minutes transformer totally different pizza also not the best start when you got to eat so much like we're doing what 10 reviews i'm already two slices deep can't do that do the math that's 20 slices orca fat too big this is way better just because hotter and floppier so i'm gonna go seven seven on this one and the other one probably would have been high sevens too if i was able to eat it fresh um that's the bonus review zoney's middletown red bank one of the other uh there's the review nicholas is right there too and he's got a pie named after me which is a regular pot you got a minutes right here uh nicholas uh now it's uh barrel and roost i took uh boom at ls a couple weeks ago i don't know i don't know what boomer is this oh so him and i for like 15 years we've been battling yeah we've been eating pizzas and stuff and here's ricky's place how are you doing roast i know nick he's making a great pizza he's naming the regular pizza after me what he named it what is it i think this just looks like a restaurant hit it but but if it's like a fancy that's not but it's not a fancy restaurant it just said it's a high-end restaurant it used to be he did now he's doing casually during clothing he can't even get in you got you need reservations like a month in advance i'll get you well that's why it's like but if you can't get in what's the point

something that is gonna shock the viewers at home I've never had a hot pocket not once never had so this will be as unbiased review as you can possibly have all right never like cook in microwave I'd rather get a full blown microwave Pizza throw in the oven and wait 25 minutes now you can cook these in the oven but I think in the spirit of what a hot pocket is like this is designed for the microwave so enough throw this in because I'm reading the directions it's like prep it unwrap it and unwrap it and put it in a crisping sleeve and place on paper plate so it like comes with a crisp it is basically begging you it's saying Dave don't put me in the oven for 25 minutes like a slob this is quick this is fast put me in the microwave my hopes they couldn't be lower like again if you put something in a microwave how can you expect the flavors to burst and pop and crisp the microwave is a notorious floppy man it's like you know I don't want throw stones I'm done picking on jacks but everything comes out tasting like jacks when you put microwave I did cook Jackson in an oven by the way it just tasted like a microwave disgusting but this is about hot pockets notice back to Jack there's about hot pockets so this will be fast it says uh one sandwich two minutes three a hunk right compact microwave three minutes and ten seconds so we'll see it I'm gonna put it in the sleeve I'm gonna chef it up hot pockets big big big big review I know everything about the top pocket is it pizza no it's a hot pocket but whatever gets court Z rules anything goes alright I'm back three minutes later hot pockets here we go and I gotta be honest I'm confused a little bit by this I actually in my three minutes in between when I last visited with you in between me putting it in the microwave I was like how can this go from totally frozen two totally cooked in three minutes so I googled it whether it's supposed to be in the refrigerator or the freezer it says freezin shocking so here we go Hut pockets for cheese pizza that's one do it says his pizza says right in the box I don't know what is a pop-tart is a sandwich one of those debates is a hotdog his sandwiches a pup is a hot pocket a pizza is it a sound I don't but I'm gonna I'm gonna eat it and I'm gonna score cuz that's what I do one bite everybody knows rules Hut pockets and here's the crisp and carry so cook then fold this flap first okay I'm gonna follow these directions like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I guess you eat it like this one bite no pun intended push it up it's soft and mushy which I again expect from a microwave cooked item but again listen hot pockets if you don't put on the box for best results use microwave I mean for best results use oven then I'm gonna microwave it like it couldn't be clearer they're begging you to microwave everything's about mark wave and then fine point it's like use the oven fine I'll microwave it that's how you want it done let's see what we got hot pockets hot pockets is that how it goes hot pockets or is that some other add one bite at my nose tools this is gonna burn my faces is to burn the face off thing uh package alert a package alert hello all right cool we'll just leave it there thank you Thanks yeah the packages are coming people the unboxing six it never ends it never ends I'm a one-man Broadway show now just unpacking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] big announcement coming up to tonight for the unboxing 6ob their B's square what else getting this quarantine take a bite babe they want to know what you think about hot pockets stop talking just eating relax everyone just chill out it's a family show yeah burns you okay we know that answer yep we just found that antelope the hard way it absolutely burns you it was burn my face off I have nowhere to go I wasn't kikuna burn this doesn't taste like pizza I'm not I'm not gonna say this is a pizza this just tastes like hot marinara sauce with floppy bread on it like I'm scooping bread into a bowl with sauce be careful Dave you just you learned a valuable lesson about the hot pocket game it'll come for your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gums little come for your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tonsils it'll leave no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] remorse no prisoners and take your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] face with it so be careful so much Brett it's like a UH a breadstick at like Olive Garden or like Carrabba's Italian Grill or something it's good but it's not pizza that you can't put pizza this is just hot pocket um cheesy bread so I don't even know there's Pizza no.17 like it's just it's not pizza everyone hotpokket hotpokket hotpokket its

punch I never do I've never talked about eater I just do my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing I become the big pizza man but let me tell you all right first of all those rumors I was opening a pizza place okay in New York City they wrote an article that was happening like and yeah I was in talks I've been in talks a million [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] times do I have a pizza place no I do not so first of all the article is dead wrong but here's what they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] write the article looks like they importantly the founder of the popula popular openly and aggressively missile genic sports and pop-culture blog parcel sports and a man known for frequently footik putting his foot his mouth is opening a restaurant the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that all about just taking shots at me all over the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] board and they continue bouncing sports no known for being crude and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that first of all you're writing a story that's totally wrong then you're just taking shots up me for no reason fast forward I go to Angelo's pizza and Philly great spot gave it a great review get along with the owner everyone Phil you happy big lines blah blah blah right well they write an article about it guess what this is the number one [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] article eater had all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] year because they put my name on it and I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sell newspapers I put asses and seats so they write an article about me right they do their review the number one literally the number one story of the year the lines at Angelo's peach are ridiculous at their parcels sports review and then the first line for some reason people listen a bar so sports Dave port on Pizza recommendations what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what do you mean for some reason because I review pizza every day because I don't have alternative agendas because I'm not a snowflake or a blue checkmark like apparently the people idea and I'm sure there's a couple good people in here but there's a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

before i score i'm going to give this the benefit of a cool because sometimes this is so hot out of the oven i was waiting to get the flop you got to let it firm up that's just an insider trick that's

because I wanted to get the invite so I'd show that honey but now we can talk about it Tommy's all right let's see but a little too deep when you get the punch on the first fight instead of the punch that even gives you a little bit enhances the score you mean when he picked it up like when I ripped it off right away I knew that that was good right there's big crunch it's very crispy oh I'm starving too I feel like I had a doctor's appointment Avenue in since midnight Danika where you like gearing up for this by the way is all person by the way here's your soul electric from the person but the exact one is one of the truth on that is like tennis I deliver on him every time and now I got to be myself and look at there is the real Tommy this is the guy who owns it you know this is your spot yes tommy was 42 years only the best ingredients by the way enough playing around rolled on 45 minutes we met Lorenzo he told us you guys have the best city our best beats in the city everything I haven't given the score yet uh uh is gonna be hi is how high are we so I know I'm your guest but you're my guest do you go first do I still go far you always [Music] I won't hire this Vargas all via face like funny and I ever known a pizza place you're going to eat I get it now because I got to be modest because I know the beats is better than that but 8-3 is strong and I want you to go high that's low this it is the perfect mix of holy crispy but like it's a sigma dodge football feat Ximena has the car so many pizzas like this has the plop this thing pure Chris excellent taste I'm glad I came out eight-six you you you just got lowball by your hold on I had this is a legitimate eight-six Pete and I went high that I thought you were going to go a little higher I screwed up my point once on on 7 7 right it's about two months ago when it first aired right yeah I said I'm gonna write this down I might not be invited but I knew you were coming sooner or later right so I was off by point one over your score you open it up so you guess what I write and you never you never get behind so he said this on the day we met what I would put down for the good and I know you don't give out high scores but I had faith eight senses super-high exact eight-six is immediate Hall of Fame score there's a line after it is at 86 so here's the thing when I give this for the only ones that really get about 86 of the old-school qualifier like the John John's bleaker you know Patsy's this type of ovens to get that high of a score is almost impossible we got maybe like the highest score we got with what I would say is a traditional off I'm so pissed off about this Bible you went a little higher he's like my god I wish there's great pizza I wish I had the magic hand for 42 years

385,(Denny Hamlin) Barstool Pizza Review - Harry's Italian,_UdqCmAbGZE, [Music] Oh video on video that's at first alright Frankie we aren't Harry's which we're location are we out right now we're in the financial district so Rock we're out Gold Street Gold Street two goals tree NASCAR Daytona 500 champ Denny Hamlin we're all in on NASCAR so we met I think we met right before you got it went out into the introductions it was my first NASCAR weekends yep I loved it I am all in on NASCAR so I'm psyched you're here I was following it studying it learning it up on it by the way I'm going to gonna go to Talladega and I'm going to press out those holiday come on that's gonna be it now I've been told the fall one is is the one to go to over the spring I agree with it okay so those are the two I'm going to also you kind of upset the well you didn't upset the world because you're up there but everyone all weekend was telling me they're going Ford Ford or you're running fast Toyota's everywhere you got a gotta have skill too alright so take this one bite everybody knows the rules are you hungry at least I am hungry Super Bowl champ by the way that's the amount of regular old cheese pizza here huh it's the gold medal slice so we do every guy based on that right like Megas you're you want to compare apples Apple correct if you do pepperoni a mushroom out of the place you can't do it alright so one bite ever and it's warm at least we're already winning there we are was freezing here by the way no not as warm as Daytona I'm psyched now Frankie I'm gonna be honest like if you told me a month ago hey you get through pizza at the Daytona 500 we're not be like that's cool but now that I consider myself a gearhead and I'm all in on ESCO you know now I'm going to get kind of it all yeah process on I like that one bite every nose rules absolutely I didn't wanna go as Elliot on Friday yeah now start he buried it it was an amateur review he absolutely buried it he was very hard on the place of probably heading out of business well I'll be honest with you we don't have the best pizza places to choose from the North Carolina but I would eat this pizza again I mean is it out of the park I can tell you if this was 2 a.m. I'd say I'd give it an extra number but right now I'm gonna go with probably we'll go to 8 1 on this one 8.1 I can live with that score I think that's a professional score because this pizzas pretty good Frankie oh eight one eight for me if you get over eight that's a superstar piece people are running for new york is driving okay well that you're just in the scale for me then I'm just telling you how I okay then I am I did be a 7/6 in if you're saying 8c that's kind of like what I think about you know women general when people talk about tens right I don't believe in tents so I don't think tens exist there's always flaws somewhere that you may not see I also all right so here's I agree with you I always say that during interviews if you give a ten what happens if tomorrow you Oh eat something better than you screwed there you have to set that the gold you know the ten is is on a table it's not out there we keep eating this so I mean I'm going with the seven six just because in in the general public's perspective you would probably say this is an eight and a half pizza but being that we're gonna temper our expectations and Tipper the public's expectation solid seven said okay I love the score unfortunately Daytona 500 champ or not the first score you give stick so you are on the record with an eight point one that's like I can do with that I'll take your score though because I think that's fair I'm go seven seven I think seven seven is pretty good pizza Frankie there's a seven point seven pizza 8.1 which I don't think is crazy by the way from the two-time Daytona 500 champion by the way Steak and Shake that's the move after you win I saw it twice right you've done that twice now I did okay and by the way love Daytona but that is like five-star dining down there so I can feed the whole crew for 200 bucks I don't big-time so Joe gives the whole thing it's awesome and again I keep saying it oh I got up by the way the jacket you do by Jack can you comment on there's the alright break it so hold it we are going at a half racing suit on right now head to toe and watch out you have an announcement we're friends right now we may be sponsoring our car in those two races so we may be rough this race and a little bit of enemies in those future races for now friends future potentially competitive you need to tell the team make sure you have a radio that can communicate to the driver yeah well I think so I went in the monster I could listen in to you guys talking but yes if I'm involved I don't want to be the one on them with yeah all right Daytona 500 squeeze us in congrats again if you haven't been to a NASCAR race I keep saying it come well we'll be at those two Talladega Bristol under the lights and we may put him in the wall maybe maybe not going to watch out for the champ that's a review you

I just want to use this example you would think as I'm feeling the crust that it would be brittle and flaky but look it's not so I said I was gonna be disappointed when I got the cross oh okay now like every other thin pizza that slice got massacred right now it's gonna kill me when I get to the end didn't this is an amazing feat amazing strong I could I could eat that whole thing and another one and most likely another a third eye I can't do my boys in Chicago wrong so I don't know if I have a new favorite what is the score system zero through ten and zero being the best no zero been in the worst so there's like figure skating rules okay now keep that mine because if you go surprise another I'm not that weird Eastern Bloc judge it's miss Cuba scores down okay I wouldn't expect that out of here I I'm gonna store it I'm gonna score tonight when we eat Frankie that is so ridiculously high I don't want to do so then Giordano's in Chicago is what is a tent that is the tents Tim so what if you have a better piece in that then what do you do you score to touch but then it's the same as you see it's yourself in rarefied air that's a biggest game rules that's why you can't ever get unless it's Mary Lou Retton you can't ever give out the ten this nine point eight is almost gone oh I see you have to give up the ten that way when someone else gets a ten it means something this pizza I want I want with my heart and soul to give it a ten but I can't do my boys of Chicago wrong but this is awesome this is a nine point eight for sure every chance okay then Pizza not really a fan but I wasn't I hated tons of cheese but not too much cheese the sauces mix perfect I thought the crust was gonna be like super Gridley it was like flaky soft imagination Wonderland it's amazing I almost have to don't want to let him go and just want to go to some of our favorite places and see what he does Frankie because if this is a nine point eight then you know goats can fly this was a six point eight it's a good score not so he needed somebody who thinks re not Eastern Bloc judge that skews Dada I'm fair this Latvia you're being like no no there's something right look we got people a window Frankie have you tasted by pie this is taste my paw six point eight I want you to taste by nine point eight everyone knows that is a you understand what's going on right now I'm gonna loves it he's laughing likey in here yeah I don't hate I'm just gonna I'm gonna give this box back to you okay and there it is 9.8 you shouldn't eat the whole thing it's a 6.8 that's somebody who's just I think no matter what we fed him he would have been a high nines [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] walk oh no walkers you got me saying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] well you don't like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] block is part of it he likes it as walkers he knows everyone will call it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] blockers it is a week from Friday see it John Cena thank these hands are huge it also Bridget says I've ever seen manipulating the slices of pizza and not get you messed up so I think I was built for this pizza I think this is like this is hitting my wheelhouse it's got yeah you didn't like it because these guy I didn't hate it but we visited through we've done 350 in a row every day different place so we don't care well Jota gave all 9.8 baby are they all good no they're not they're not all good there's a lot of good a lot of bad yeah yeah what's the worst place you Mitch plays Pizza late zero and zero zero is that bad they give you a pizza yeah they did get a zero LeBron's place blaze pizza zero you bastard your soul that is so biased why subscribe is school it was fair because a basketball player owns a pizza he just happened over donut stop this did they give you pizza in it ok how can it be a zero is horrible no zero would be like I'd like a slice Juanita's addictive ass we're out no it was that's a zero this is zero yo ass it should be a point one or it should be like oh that's like saying that you shouldn't give a ten no you should give a ten ten is perfect zero so bad that it's a zero is reserved for someone that cannot deliver you a good so it's using it doesn't exist yeah alright fine point one is almost more insulting no problem it's like leave it a one said yeah yeah yeah alright that's it's more insulting you ready to get nothing because they did it on purpose if they give you the one I just boosted your rating up you're welcome there it is that's a review John Cena the hands gigantic walkers Friday see it big hands big gloves yeah

chicken all right fine we're at the corner of 7th and 8th 148 special guests Doug Flutie the one the only now we're supposed to do this yesterday I'm going back to Boston to the Bradys funeral obviously they're huge craters guys so and I actually told them was supposed to do I told the answer is I don't love that people love that we're doing it together very close now this is specially for me because I don't think you know top three I'm a Boston guy grew up in Swampscott top three athletes growing up a ball time Larry Bird Doug Flutie and this is the Hail Mary shirt by the way throws it down cut by Boston College I don't believe it that's a touchdown Eagles win it they wore they had the big perforated threw it up and on Nomar those are my three guys I still hate weight books he's like all my absolute hate list but when he played Rob Johnson over you that ice I think about like five times a week still just for those who don't know this guy ten and five Buffalo I had the original Flutie place they bench him because of a bye week which has never been done in the history of football I really don't think it was weights decision I think was higher but that's alright you can blame way this guy if you haven't watched Flutie play not only BC obviously the greatest Canadian player of all time he'd run 30 yards downfield turn throw backwards it was backyard football and do you think if you wait in that because they're biased against your gonna hide and now you got you know Russell Wilson you no doubt the offense today more spread-out quarterback runs the zone read stuff much more suited to that it's a lot like what we did so I'm a little jealous of these guys today no doubt about it absolutely the one guy who they just want to give a shot like Ditka would do it and be like three steps you aren't Jeff George they didn't give you a shot this is the worst so thank you for doing it this is big for me I got tuck it in so what we do we take one bite ready to take one bite is for it zero to ten we took you to a garbage spot because you had to be in this area I should say that let's be fair we don't know yeah it's like you let's let's give it a shot yeah it does so one bite ever knows the rules Doug Flutie which I even had you a little starting line up figure I had it all along [Music] it's like hockey rink my favorite pizza that's a term I use do you really not like yeah hey I'll get a slice of cheese yeah come down it was the frozen pizzas but actually and these are just mass guys right here just a bunch of bonus the bonus is that at least the crust a

Stouffer's here we go I gave it a big build up because it was one of my childhood favorites now this and this is what I said at the beginning I remembered it being 45 minutes it said 25 minutes 24 minutes a cook and American classic by the way but that's just lying it does not take 24 minutes to cook this this cook took far more probably closer to 40 and here it is it's fresh out of the oven it looks innocent a little a little stupid no this is a weapon right now this thing under this layer of cheese is the most smoldering hot sauce pizza you will ever encounter Frankie put the warning up kids at home you will burn your face off if you don't use caution with this all right let's see what we got cut it on by there knows the rules used back to the fork and knife situation Stouffer's

everyone's like oh I hope he burns his face that's me one bite but I held the sauce go this is warm Brett it's so good though nobody ever knows the rules did what happened maybe it was overcome what's

school so do they talk to you like just uh so this is all comes down from what may like who's actually making the rules i do not know this is probably state that my my my thing is this year that we could drive 15 minutes away from here and be in nassau county and everything's everything's normal right like you know you don't you don't think you're an epidemic you know they're 50 bar service the whole thing you know so and and state to state too it's like i mean i go down to miami it's like until recently it was open yeah it feels like a piece and even then people are going out and it's like my thing on it is you gotta let p everyone knows there is no perfect solution we can let people decide like i mean like how long for a guy like you how long can you do this where it's like so the situation is this year that in the month of december is the busiest month of the year that we have here right the christmas parties the christmas the whole thing so the money that we make for christmas here the month of december it directly drags us it lets us until january february and the middle of march but now we don't have december we're gonna have january and we're gonna february march but where's this money coming come from to to go ahead with this and how do you even know we're gonna have january very much you're hoping i'm hoping yeah yeah it's crazy you know because if you don't have nothing right now that this is the the booming season for the restaurant industry i mean how do we gonna have a january february we're gonna have many of these days here yeah and much

yep every single industry got it we are in the economical disaster right now starting from maybe this industry and climbing up to every other industry that exists but i think this is the worst because this is the business that employs more people than anybody else you could say here especially especially in new york you know so and it's christmas man it's like it's christmas time yes you know the yesterday one of my guys like you know you even said it on tv the game says it's christmas he said you know what this is fine everything he can you know to keep us here for a couple of days more but what do we do what do we do i don't have the answer right don't know i don't know there is no answer and the hardest part i know at least so you know why why we got involved with barcelona it's like same kind of thing as you a small business started work and it's like most of the guys in your shoes like they don't want it they just want the ability to like work they don't want hand they just like let us just do it the same way yeah that's how if you keep me if i'm open and you keep me going with all the safety of course with all whatever whatever safety guards we need to take let me operate right i don't want nothing from anybody right i know it's just bridges the gap to win this thing but when you need it you need it all at the same time you know when it's needed it's needed yeah it's not that you know i don't want to sound like a superman here because i'm not but at the same time it's like with you're going dry right you're going to dry out at one point the well there's no more water to pull out right yeah conversation about it but now i feel like you don't want to have a little whatever just there we go baby so what do we got here you eat the ricotta salad oh you ordered it is this the oxtail that's oxtail this is the upstairs right here so this is literally the tail of an ox yes try the first the pasta am i just going hands and what energy fredo alfred why is that is that his name fredo alfredo alfredo all right what's your signature dish do you have one i have one i have the mezzoluna ravioli actually i did that for kidding around one many years ago i stuffed it with mascarpone cheese and basil so i get i think it was a gentleman from the new york times he says master boom mascarpone is for fruit for tiramisu oh it says i said i don't know who he was but he says you know what i want to try the ravioli off the chart i'm gonna you want to try a couple of them i'm a couple you tell me i mean i don't want you i wanted to have the whole menu here but build it when you did the video everyone was telling me that you're the best place in the store i got a million of those million of those being like oh yeah food's amazing well we've been here for 21 years before this year i i started with a small pizzeria on 30th avenue and then i opened up this place thank you thank you that's the thing that's wildly uh frustrating like you were saying there's no rhyme or reason to anything it's like you can go into certain places again obviously gonna be able to food shop but you can go into a grocery store no problem same thing yeah my friend is in the is in the shopping center and my girlfriend is in the costco it's iraq it's crazy here yeah because it's christmas season and everybody everybody everybody's out you come here and i come here fox newsmax channel two general two right yeah they were here yesterday dude thank you i kind of like that i was like you beginning to start like who me what what channel are you on two news max whoa yeah yeah how are you excellent man how are you doing this made it worth it i drove all the way from new jersey just to come support you man man and i get to run into you what's going on how are you i'm well how are you i'm good i'm up north you came here just because i'm on the nose yeah we're off today and you know everybody's reposting yeah why not actually come and support them thank you i love it no that's the right can we take a photo of course i'm gonna end up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] face i'm housing this wine like you know what can i get a bottle well i could go for a glass of wine whatever you want yeah and it is that's the other thing like this guy's like everyone wants to help there's no even another government that has no way you can just go this place has a great reputation i mean not because it's my place but i'm just saying it because look to me service is everything you know we we i go above and beyond to accommodate someone you don't like some no problem don't worry i'll make you some now you know i'll make you some i don't care when you leave here i want you to leave with a smile on your face that's my that's my priority that's my number one thing you can say you know what the food sucked the food but when you leave here you know what the guy went above and beyond to make this make it worse yeah that's what matters so and i got like again support you know support the support is the support of banavi man it's just you know it's amazing you know i've been in the story all my life my family came from a story on the greek ship we came here and we learned the writing story you know so my uncle was living and uh this was it make sure that the ravioli are you with this guy yeah you mad me i'm just asking no you want to try one piece of ravioli you take one of my things oh you got it so this is your dish amazing this is the one that it's made with uh but the pastas are very light yes you know and homemade you can tell so this is a little bit different because the bakery the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it in italy it's called many different versions you know it means smacks you know because they're big oh yeah you mean the taste no no the taste the the shapes the shape of the box that's on the face with it well because they're big yeah yeah now you know it's all out of this die for example this year i can make a cannelloni out of it i make this and i also make the akala marada which is like like a calamari shape yep a little bit shorter than that so what's the plan moving forward yeah uh well hopefully hopefully we'll be reopening again number one um but it's it's not i think the whole industry this whole industry is not in a great spot right now and i don't think it's from tutorial in control but i'm referring to the whole yeah right the whole uh

pennsylvania what makes us a little different is that we cook our pizza with no cheese and then we wait until it comes out of the oven to throw on our shredded provolone cheese toppings are also cold like pepperoni we have a bunch of other cold ones but you can also get warm toppings like sausage and mushroom also you can order it with the cheese melted but i definitely recommend everyone should

they're like you gotta go to costa's pizza you have to go the guy's a character it's unbelievable pizza the guy's a character [Music] i'd understand half the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he was saying his daughter's in there the daughter was in my bronco which bran [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] knew things kind of shark she's in it before i even knew he's saying greeks invented pizza is that a fact yes sir look it up for the hidden aprils they were making focaccia and sincerely why'd you do any grief people stop making it you guys make the square but you don't see it very that you only get what before i went to napoli it was in greece he did the whole thing he said pizza not soup like i tell people on the box pizza i'm not sure what i'll show you soup yeah you're pre-reviewing my review i do that anyways i do all the stuff you're doing anyway i'm just correct i'm not trying i don't know you're trying to upstage me that's fine i'll do this with the customers he gave me an extra slice here i'm gonna put this just down for a minute i got desserts from his wife who literally was hanging on every bite like in there as people are eating it like is it going to be good she's watching her every move she's like i make them so i hate to see people's reactions again he says pizza not soup i say sometimes it's people not pizza it's people not pizza like what a story cost at the end i'm an idiot i'm like what's your name again it's like cost is you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] one bite everyone has the rules it is and now he held it up remember what he did in there he's like pizza not soup very thin a little bit of grease there good undercarriage very light see what we got i love the guy i [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love the guy and we're probably gonna have to go back in there and we're probably gonna have to say like i don't even know if i paid so i gotta give it a good score i hope it's good one bite everyone knows rules cost this we're in pompano beach if you haven't eaten at costas for the greek of the pizza what are you doing in this area okay yeah thank you wow okay it tastes like greek pizza like captain pizza swampscott mass greek pizza that's what this kind of tastes like it is much lighter now greek greek pizza my experience is very greasy and maybe that's why i said it you see a little bit of the oil but this is super thin great crunch but it is heavy wow what do i score this so he said he watches me almost every day i love the i love the thinness i love the crisp but it is a little heavier than what i generally like but that is greek style sure now he gave me an added and he told me what this was and i don't really remember but this is specialty slice that we'll just call a specialty slice that he told me to try he's flip-flopping all over the place very good but again if i thought the other was heavy he invented this slice i like to cheese more the better the goat to the milk too much on my pizza is still good 7-2 on this one and then the desserts which were homemade oh wow i don't even know what kind of cookie this could possibly be [Music] again i don't generally love greek desserts it's not my favorite type of desserts but this is as good a greek dessert as i've ever had what a pastry no wonder the white was looking at us like oh my god oh my god i'm gonna go seven nine on the pastry spectacular overall i've never really heard too much greek like here at greek pizza and pizzeria um i would put this on my must stops of places to go like if my my good friend guy fieri like he gets all pissed guy fieri if you say ferry i don't know if he has gone here to

mouth i don't know how this has a better rating than brothers i thought i just saw a porsche it wasn't and i was stunned because there can't be any porsches in west virginia right like nobody has a poi if you have a porsche in charlestown west virginia you're demented in the brain i'd like to do some research on that how many porsches in charlestown west virginia in the history i'd say zero or

nailed it yeah i know who you are i just didn't want to interrupt you yep no well that's fine we do pizza reviews we go everywhere we try pizza we rate the pizza well that's good pizza have you had brothers across the street i have they have a good margaret pizza which one do you think is better oh out of the two yeah listen i'll tell you out of my opinion on all the pizza places around here every piece of place around here has it going for them they all do something different every single one of them is good but if you have a dying if you're on your death bed and you can only one which one would you work i'd order one of each and i'd take a slice out of each because if i'm on my deathbed i got it all right well you can only have one bite of one and you're dying which one will you choose ooh that's tough uh andes i'd get 80s you know andy's you know they're good but anthony is good wait a minute we're talking about brothers first i haven't had jesus brothers and ransom it's just kind of good brothers is good brothers so it's bro this is just because i just did brothers so i've never had anders did you get the margaret pizza from brothers i just got cheese pizza please go back and get the margo and do it again margarita the margarita pizza are you gonna answer would you have brothers or this one or we just it would be brothers would be the marvelous pizza what about we deal with this guy every day he's my business partner sympathy for me yeah i got to put up with him all day cheese pizza anthony's first brothers well it can't be cheese because this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guy won't answer the question just anthony's i think a person 100 cheese pizza anthony okay that i dragged that i dragged you to the finish i think brothers i think bro this tastes like dominoes i'd get brother's pizza all right so but i think that their general their food is a little bit better is that fresh and hot yes give it five minutes and try it again let it cool yep okay why do you think it tightens up it's better okay give it five minutes open like that well we're at five minutes i've been we've been you've been filibustering with not giving an answer for ten minutes three three i have more respect for this guy having to deal with you on 24 7 basis yeah that's a tough answer i i much prefer brother's cheeks but you and that's what you said no you said anthony's but i would call their margarita pizza closer to a cheese piece a real cheese pizza than i would call that or their cheese pizza go get the margarita pizza and try again okay i'm not gonna do that i mean just have it we gotta go back with the thing this to me buy it for you i'll warn you you'll be ready when you get there you're that convinced of the margarita 100 are you ready all right sir best pizza in town better than brothers brothers is good but not since the old man sold it i'll vote for another vote for anthony's i prefer i i just had it i preferred brothers their cheese against their cheese anthony's takes it for me but i'm calling in i'll pay for it but if you're this convinced on a margarita pizza from you gotta try it it's good yes i haven't read it this is like a this i'd give a four

want this this pizza socked no offense well back to brothers yeah because he was he was obsessed with a margarita pizza he made it sound like the guy in here was obsessed with the other places pizza the guys on the street was making it sound like the margarita pizza is going to be like better than john's a bleaker which i know it's not but he was so adamant about it that we got to give it a shot all right i mean when i say adamant he was he was adamant that the margot which i've never heard a call by the way yeah me neither margaret he kept saying get the margot pizza all right around and around we go to places that aren't that good in west virginia all right so on something that i did not expect to be happening today i'm back at brother's deli in charleston west virginia for my second pizza from there because kevin from the auto store over there who i couldn't get an answer was saying this is the greatest margot pizza ever existed so here it is the brothers deli margot pizza let me tell you something it doesn't look half bad like i didn't know what i was expecting and smell the fresh basil on it smells actually pretty good so maybe margot pizza is a little hidden gem this is like uh you know the creme de la creme of margot pizzas so see what we got it's definitely gonna burn my face off because i was waiting where early because i'm just now going strip mall charlestown pizza i gave the first one a 5 8 and i'm told thank you i appreciate it is the man international or is the man international i mean if you told me when i started doing this pizza like i could be in charlestown west virginia and like guys and women would be like oh what's up dave barcelo pizza i've been like what planet are you on it is kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] surreal one bite everyone knows rules this is gonna burn my face the margot pizza per kevin's recommendation who called it in but i did pay okay that was a colossal waste of time not much difference between the cheese in fact as i'm trying to go back in my brain if i close my eyes would i know this wasn't the cheese yeah it's a little bit different but i definitely like here more than andy six anyone who likes andy6 doesn't know anything about pizza this is better pizza no doubt i uh is it better than cheese no i prefer the cheese i'm gonna go i don't know five five on this um i may just got you know what that dude kevin from the auto body shop may have just taken this city slicker for a ride because you know what i'm gonna do now and go drop this pizza off to all his people and he's laughing all his way to two free pieces being like that fool thinks he got me i got him maybe [Music] there it is kevin here kevin kevin just walked out back all right so bring him this he told me this is the best pizza around he's wrong he's strong enough yeah i told him i'd drop it off when we're done tasting it but margo so you guys can have it appreciate it yeah yeah no worries he wasn't he was wrong about that pizza being this

I've learned you don't like yours to do research I like it yeah this is dope horrible though a lot of times I think what I'm going to sell I'm convinced they've never seen a pizza in their lives that's gonna be terrible that's not not because I was coming through turn four he wanted the low-side gift me so I made sure he had the low side on the corner anyway and then we both spun to be clipped me do you honestly think that could have been your fault he should've lived it yeah and then he's like I should have listened Yeah right on both side but we were going for a million bucks this isn't bad in this try by the way the short track this is where everyone is a novice man so the three races I did um I did Daytona and then after I did I loved it I've never been a race I mean everyone said you go to Talladega do here those are the three that people said I had yeah your top three for sure okay in this one because it's short you guys are just like crashing into belly rub and racing style yeah this one's back to the roots and everybody started Bristol Martinsville Richmond they're all the short tracks where we're kind of being bang a little but it's not that big of a deal at 200 miles an hour bigger tracks you can't really beat the tangle yeah well I'm looking forward to out the lights this is a good review but over the track yet no we got an RV we're living on campus track is like ten-story tall grandstands it's a big bowl it's more impressive than I think the Rose Bowl and big stage but I did why I mean I saw like the football game that they did what kind of scene Virginia Tech the Battle of Bristol yeah I'm not coming in here like yeah I'm not just a novice here I'm coming to pick NASCAR I'm pretty good so what's the squirrel this has been going on with this one I know the product placement by the way although I love this guy's on an off point they like probably glue got to his hand as is walking in now the monsters great they're fun to do all kinds of granny 7.1 like a vertical fairs wore out probably go six-five you gotta be a way better that's a fair score the race is tomorrow 7:30 the NBC Sports Network so there's NBC and then there's NBC Sports Network 7:30 NBC Sports Network yes tell me what's the next one where you say Watkins Glen to the post office those the other ones let it go yeah walking through them be fun so what would be other narrowing that I should hit I would go to well walk into them we just raced there Pocono was a couple weeks before that are you going out this year um general playoffs kickoff in Vegas right that's a good place to go for a party interphase yes but here's all part Miami that's where the championship ends you got Charlotte for the road course what's your favorite doesn't matter the area it's crystal really real I mean you're six times Bush family one of the others probably gonna win maybe they'll crash and fight which would be awesome um that's a good racing outside of fighting with the dryer no but it's good you're gonna learn you're posting a video yesterday with the Miley's to like crew chiefs are like right they're both like overweight wrestle around on the ground it was awesome all right it was awesome it was awesome you

last time i did it i'm old for two eating these things so so this you saw the whole deal i've been waiting like two days for this uh cheesesteak difficult process to order it hopefully it's worth it and again i'm not saying i'm a cheesesteak expert i'm not i'm a pizza expert i put in the time i went to the gym i've done a thousand pizzas this is what my second and third cheesesteak ever the ones i gotta do i did the alessandros john's rose pork beard award winner i thought they only did fancy places uh i got to do angelo's my favorite pizza in the city people say that may have the best uh cheesesteak and i gotta do steve's the prince of stakes those are the ones people say and then genos and pats are the taurus ones but the locals like don't even bother i probably will bother all right let's see what we got and i'm ordering it how i like it this is going to be i don't like whiz i don't even know if they have whiz here i think wiz is garbage it's like cheese whiz i don't like it i'm going with the provolone and fried onions so let's see what we got here looks good and by the way because i'm a nice guy i ordered it from our gambling house like a million of them one bite ever knows the rules john's roast pork that looks [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] great what's up it's really good i like to use steaks as much as the next guy but there's not as much differentiation like hi i could hear you talking about me all right this is better than d los angeles like the alessandro is good this is better what am i gonna put on a scale it's still a little bit of a weird scale a little bit because frankly i don't know where to start also camera guy we don't have frankie here we go kevin who's taller so when i look at the camera i'm looking at your eyes as opposed to the camera it's making me very weird yeah you got gotta put the camera in my eyes so i'm talking to the camera not your face uh i'm gonna go this is what i'm talking about if d'allosandros is how i started the scale i think i gave that a seven eight if that's now the barometer this is like an e3 i'm not saying it's an e3 go but i've set a scale now that i judge everything versus d'alessandro so d'alessandro seven eight this is eight three i also got the roast pork because they call it a roast pork i don't know if i should eat that i'm also gonna weigh a hundred pounds because what i'm noticing unlike a couple bites of pizza i'm eating the whole cheese steak like i'm just sitting here talking eating it next thing you know i'm 400 pounds wearing skinny jeans like a fatso i'm gonna try to find the roast pork real quick all right so here's the roast pork and then the name of the place is roast pork so obviously you gotta give that a shot uh we'll see what we like more the cheese taking the roast pork again not the healthiest way to start a saturday try not to drop it so this is the roast pork with spinach by the way in provolone and what i liked about it when i ordered it they just told me how to get it i'm like rose pork i go spinach provolone right i'm like yeah right give me that nope not my cup of tea much prefer this cheesesteak i mean that's all right i just don't i don't know roast pork no i'll never eat that again that was like a uh no maybe great rough pork not my cup of tea 4-2 on the roast pork cheese steak 8-2 the best i've had in the city uh steve's are coming for you angelos we're coming for you and then we're going to go back to pizza because the cheesesteak's not my thing and philly people like hey why are you rating cheesesteaks because i'm trying to be a philly guy all right chill dude i am the biggest fan i should have knocked my shoulders out before i had to wait two hours i actually left a message for you on facebook man oh i don't check the facebook yeah we tried the pork i like the cheese steak yeah well it's kind of an acquired taste yeah you know but see that's what my grandfather started in 1930 with the pork yeah he's just so important to people with a wooden shack right here you know so what what percentage of people get the pork versus the cheesesteak it used to be like five to one on the floor to state yeah it's kind of like one to one even more two states now since like see i left school my dad got lung cancer and i was in my third year of city joe's but i was like a psychology degree i wanted to be a sports psychologist all right but uh three years you know you're a long way from yeah even any month yeah no i hear this place i mean this place is yeah like it's a nice family right my 87 year old mom is still my boss oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's my wife making sandwiches you know right i knew you were in the area i saw wow yeah i saw the dallas piece you know and like you know i learned from the owner of pat stakes frankie alvarez like just played star mistakes yep and like we became friends and like we're all kind of friends you know like it's like he taught me like rising you know ships like yeah yeah so ours is a little different like we don't offer cheese whiz you know south america so i'm not a big fan of jesus you know yeah no so i thought it was provolone no i like american cheese but yeah i don't know what you got i think i ordered american and they gave me pro they said you light provolone i thought three cheese steaks with uh onions and american fried onions american cheese and you want three cheese steaks you want me to make it one more no i i i wait what which one it looks like a little bit of shark forever yeah so i said america and then they said you want [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because i like americans all right we'll get a special one we're gonna get a special or whatever the guy wants a special one we'll go only because like really i tell everyone get america all right because it overpowers the state all right all right let me take care all right all right so we're waiting now on a special maid from the owner of the place that's gonna give me american i thought i ordered american and they told me to do provolone whatever we'll wait we've got a special one coming out is this the special this is the uh the ford this is the way john's dad is i already had the pool you had the port i bought the pool how'd you get it with uh it was provolone and spinach this is uh mustard raw onions but i didn't like the pork no not for the pork people yeah he told me you have to try it this way [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it the guy's telling me to try it this way i already said i don't want the pork what is on this uh mustard raw onions and seed and pepper well i don't like my mustard so we're off in a good start but to tell me i like the raw onions actually it works together so no this is good like i'm not a huge poor guy but this is better than the way i got it which is what with the spinach and sharp which is what your people recommend i wouldn't eat it with this minute and sharp well then i mean the person the person will answer the phone i said pork they said with spinach and provolone right that's how most people get it i wouldn't eat it like that though and then can i get uh one roast pork orange this is better than i like it your way yeah that's the way uh john's father used to eat it so who's the guy was talking to before that was john john all right so they're all named john uh he's it was his uh grandfather's business uh he was dominic he owned it and then his father was john and now john this one's made out of american cheese and but we make them all out of love you know it's just yours with sharper blonde it's not good i don't like it so well but then uh here's my question when i called i said american and they said you mean provo they switched my order yeah but listen you know you see the line all the way down so you know this one's made out of oh they're all made they're always like this one's got a little listen of course but i don't want anyone to think you know i know you saw that you know same amount of meat i love the other one here we go

hot one clearly um i like the guy in there no joke guy get the full get up from new york he's tech take it actually i understand we meant pizza lessons as we speak from uh steven spielberg's personal pizza guy whatever that means anybody else taking class while they're making pizza for you thinking what anybody else taking class when they're having pizza videos no my friend is the uh personal pizza chef or steven spielberg slow ride and he's amazing he's working with a friend of mine from general oh so you're taking classes right now i don't understand what you meant that first that was cool one bite everyone knows the rules this is neapolitan style though a lot of people have said it's really good most people know how i feel about neapolitan right it's like six eight i start there it's a personal style pizza but it's not always my favorite so i start assume if it's the best a standard neopolitan six eight if it goes above i think it's better if it goes below it's worse but that's my average for neapolitan some people's cup of tea is not necessarily mine one fight everybody knows i mean as you can probably tell in there it's super fresh you can tell everything's super fresh super light super good it was a very good neopolitan pizza have i imagined the apollo is not my favorite style of all time yup so if we're strong six eight seven one significantly better than the average neapolitan good outdoor down there this is a big place huh have you ever had a daddy no i never have no very good so 7-1 cool outdoor dining good spot what's going on that guy's got a very cute dog chicago is buzzing by the way it's like 70 and sunny out and everyone's out um so that's a review i highly recommend it as a date spot spaka napole pizzeria sunnyside ave chicago that's a review this is for the flop test you know portfolio right portofolio no oh you want to do the whole there you go and what do you do with that you eat it on the street this is what you did 300 years ago in naples and you just take a bite like this way that's what you're doing all right i've never have you ever seen this style eddie never what the portfolio 300 years ago in naples and i believe napoli all right fine i'm going to burn my face off probably one of those junkies no i'm gonna burn my face no no i heard it i saw you with your tongue yeah i know i had a bad injury i had a bad injury that wasn't burned that was misbiting [Music] so first bite i only got the breath you gotta wake your way that was a very good bite i feel like you're italian right now you ever tell anybody to eat your pizza this way you tell people to eat your pizza as well or the garbage men or the service people that's how they do it i'll give it to them in their truck yeah you know what a steel fight is right i'm still i the only thing i taste is the fresh bread the biggest concern is if you have a pizzeria if you see the finish on it they leave it on the on the plate they eat around it they leave the corner that's the bread the bread's the best part so hopefully i mean the bread spectacular now i'm getting into it you know your bones generally not my favorite style i know i like it eating it this way more that's how the kids to the bakers like for example this is cafe no his grandfather was a carpenter he was paid in brain became a baker father franco pepe's father became the first pizza maker of the family yup when in the olden days there was the stupa the kid the baker would make the pizza to send the the schoonettes the children out on the streets with the stupa the pizzas were folded our portfolio they were stacked up so is that how it's meant to be eaten that's what it was done 300 years ago that's how they should still do the neapolitan style it tastes a lot better once like not better but it's like you get more flavor i like it there's way more but that's what they we still do that today well i've never seen i've no one's ever done this for me ever and i've done a lot of the apollo no one's ever done i i don't know the words that you're using foofa luffa like combine this stuff if you had money and you were educated and from the north they would call it alibaba so the portfolio means a wallet that's opening in the north alibaba look at that you burn your face off but that that's that's how i'm only going to eat neapolis from now on thank you very much this is the way to do it thank you very much you got a whole lesson there now i love that guy he got just making it up because i don't understand a lot of words he was saying but portfolio well this is how you do it i don't even know it tastes like pizza it's just a cheese molten lava and bread i mean how can you not like this so this way this way eddie i'll give this like seven five look that you dare

so I'm like variants of seeing this and what they have you're gonna like this one cuz it's based on a true story there's a lot of them now are based on Dale art and that's the better story for me as a guy who enjoys these jobs well I I want to hear the true story shout out by the way our guy chaps Purple Heart guy works for us who's gonna be very mad we didn't invite him on this piece over you whatever [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you chaps alright the horse party yeah tell me about the horse part they drop them all more so by the way we start let's do it so you're taking the score of 1 through 10 it's one bite and then you go with the score but what about the score is what is alright now that's I thought I thought we'd meet on that someone want to go fight for that Frankie probably one byte 0 to 10 and helped us form pretty good I did I'll be taking into account the black piece I leave that deal I'm often told you ought to pull your game all right I'm gonna put it up good Brian the man's client a marine it's fine eat pizza this is not great for the whole marine image by this by the whole project it's cold it's a cold wind it's called where these are not tears any tears on my face Frankie zero zero that's the East Coast West Coast maybe a marine but he's supposed toughness so yeah this is gonna probably fall under 7.9 range borderline hi la pizza but it is tough of it look at this crowd Frankie get the crowd Rob Riggle pick Rob Rob Riggle we've done a lot of people won't be time people I don't know they move air accumulate this type of crop it's good what's that I'm gonna go I don't know seven point one I think it maybe could have been harder to heat things an interesting thing by I I accounted for the heat and that's why I bumped it up what's your favorite pizza that one I don't I like coming here though and I like folded in half you can always find a good slice here you can alright I like it this style I'm not a Chicago this is this is more like a fancy pizza model for pizza like you in order this watching the games by the way you have traditions now would you I got a hold off that's such a lame this I'll give you the predictions than anyways and the pages probably varsity Eagles and pages no on the soup oh wait you're taking the pages I would have never gone picture man I like I like the backside also I'm kind of ee we were talking about the horse thing in the movie hostile horse guy so I can appreciate all the horse stuff those guys write it in IO Lenore yeah by the way that's another thing you can bring him a good point they wrote in the war they wrote in a combat on horseback which had never been done before in the 21st century warfare but it's what they had to do because they were fighting in the mountains of Afghanistan and they were kind of very small footprint so they didn't have mechanized stuff and that what they did was amazing career like I should've done the research is this your like first serious role yeah actually I mean I've done straight roles but I would call straight roles before but this is probably more first straight dramatic role but I don't you know it's weird as hell you don't get offered a lot of roles outside of what you do well like I'm a comedic actor right and so to get drama opportunities unhappen old but this year I've got this movie coming out in another one in March called Midnight Sun which is a drama so I'm getting some more opportunities well congratulations thanks for doing the review we had a seven point nine and a seven point one Frankie is that what we had rob riggle movies out tomorrow looks awesome and again not since I was very shy see how good-looking earth so look I did seas with the guy and I got lost in his eyes yeah I know he's like my number one turns to do it's going on oh so that's it it's a review Rob Riggle see you tomorrow appreciate it thanks man great to me

angelo sent me uh a frozen pizza during coven when i switched to the frozen pizza reviews it was very good he sent me a whole letter he hadn't done anything yet his name his legitimate name is angelo pizza like his last name's pizza the guy's name is angelo pizza his last name is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pizza and i said who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] last name is pizza or something like that he's actually got the quotes i said in the review on the wall which is wild you see what it says already that's right from your review last name's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pizza yeah i've got [Music] so that basically review launched him to sell frozen pizzas which he sold a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of until they couldn't ship anymore because ice packaging so the story all right you sent me the individual then you started selling the frozens do you sell a lot of them the first ones we sold [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of them yeah and then it was going great and then the mail started screwing up because of code so maybe about i guess like six months in we started having problems where they weren't making them there in time or they wouldn't make them there at all so they'd be like not frozen or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like yeah that's an issue and they launched his own spot in philly so i'm back here for the sports bar um not really sports bar the varsity bar which is opening today um and before it opened i i always said once he got a spot i'd be here to try it so here we are one bite everyone knows the rules um it looks if i recall like the frozen pizza he's also like give me a fair score i don't want hometown cooking i like this guy a lot so what am i gonna do if i don't like it what i'm gonna give a bad review it's almost impossible um it's thin and it's small pretty straight very hot and also this is

pizza and i'll be honest my one critique if i had one slightly i like it drier like i don't like it there's a decent amount like grease on it which a lot of people three spoil however you say people say taste definitely good taste seven five very good pizza and more importantly honestly if you know anything about me and bar stool fun and everything that we've done like the guys who do what he did

restaurant is great allowed me to be able to do it but he's really sick he's got a he has als and he's i've moved him right up around the corner man i i appreciate you so much without you i never want to be able to um like i told the story while i doing the review it's like almost more important than a piece of degree i love stories like that i worked in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] insurance i hated my job hated my life as soon as that review happened i told my mom quitting my job today and i'm business not too dissimilar i hated my job before starbucks what'd you do before he did sales i like uh researching consulting company okay so i did that for like five years it's just typical sales right i did this for two years and i was i was so down pulling my hair out of my head working for her i don't think anybody wakes up and says they love their job as an insurance guy right right i mean i work probably 70 hours a week now and it's super stressful but i love it better doing it for yourself than somebody else 100 how far along i mean it's it's not great he's uh he's still living he still has his voice slow down he's still able to that story i don't the ice bucket challenge oh yeah yeah absolutely yeah i was pretty friendly with him like before any of that happened give me one let me just make sure yeah he's all good i appreciate that hey hey hey who are you who are you this is tucker talker oh my god how's it going telling him one of my good friends the star of the ice bucket challenge pete for 80s like which is yeah so they're big so i i i met him probably like when i met him he was still he had just been diagnosed so like still they did all these plunges in the ocean but so i became pretty familiar with the cause yeah you're amazing you know you saved this kid he was working for travelers and shorts and what you did was just amazing i mean you know you just opened the door for me not too dissimilar for my story i had a sales job i hated it and it's like you know what i'm gonna drive myself insane if i don't try to do it like i'm glad i mean what would you think of the pizza that was good i thought it tasted to me like the frozen pizza so i thought i didn't know what it was gonna look like i thought it was very good i can't believe you came up here man that's for your cause yeah that was a no-brainer there's no brain or a white guy what's that you're right oh yeah i appreciate it i appreciate it i appreciate it i feel honored no listen it it it's kind of humbling so i i mean i'm glad what you said is like makes it makes it worth it doing it that you know we help out not on purpose but i never would have been able to bring him up here and and do this for him if it wasn't for you so just know that you know when we're standing here right now this is because of the opportunity you gave me so very good nursing home for one day and then the italians don't do it like that you know all respect to the nursing homes and everything but i couldn't leave them there you know so you know this is how we're doing it and just do what we got to do it's a great story uh yeah i don't know what to say i don't want to tell the score right in front of you you want another score yeah do you want to score right i heard it already five seven five yes sub five okay yeah what'd you what what would you give it well if it tasted like the frozen pizza it was it's it's a little bit better than a frozen pizza i thought it was i thought it's similar to at least no but those are two different scores yeah also i'm also mad because then he pulled it out but they called it under austin so then he pulled it out of the oven i didn't get to actually put you know but it definitely wasn't there for 10 minutes that's a lie that wasn't that was a lie because we caught we called it what 10 minutes before we showed up it wasn't 10 minutes but it was up there it was up for a couple minutes yeah personally i wish i got to do it front to back but i well that's why we don't we because we don't want special treatment on the pizza even when we know the people but the frozen a frozen pizza is a totally different scale than the normal pizza because it's harder to have a good frozen pizza so no i thought it was good i didn't know what to expect my one thing which i said on which isn't always with the oil like i like like i don't this pizza if i was eating not around you guys i can't believe i'm being this dead honest i would have put a napkin on it right which i don't love doing right i'd prefer not but some people like it it's more taste but the 35's that oil comes out just so you know it's cheese we grate the pecorino romano in house it's fresh grated cheese the pepperoni oh i've heard it all oh that's i know and that's what some people get mad at me like that's because good cheese that people tell me all that listen i thought it was very good i thought it was very good i thought it it's in it you know you don't see many pizzas this size that aren't like the neapolitan like a personal pan and he actually said that you have the one size on that it's like it's like a new york nepal yeah that's the that's how i would describe it every morning yeah no listen 7-5 is a very good score it's not to sneeze at and to be honest the story is remarkable so but i can't i have it i listen i got integrity i can't just give you like a nine three no no i know i know i know i know i i get it and the seven five is yeah i'm happy about it i just i think my only regret is that i didn't pull it out of the oven i no i made it and i would have i would although i said that it was a little different he asked i can't make another one uh we have a bar here that literally open i'm not there for the opening so i'm like i got to get to that bar it's beautiful that's beautiful for electric wheelchair when i get there let us know we'll get your whole section set up there but no it's beautiful so uh that's the only reason i didn't but we got a lot of pizza makers like you who are like after they see it they're like now today i could have usually done it but sometimes if i'm in a different city we do like seven in a day and if every person wants to do another pizza it's something suddenly it's 2038 before i'm done with one day absolutely what did you think of the sauce that was good i thought the sauce is very good i like the crust yeah it's i thought 7.5 is a good quality score so this was another thing too i should throw in there we typically have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on a basil we were super busy for a thursday abnormally busy ran out of basil so i was skimping on my basil leaves that i was giving out to everybody else on the on in the sauce because i was waiting for your pie so i i got one piece of basil in there typically you'd have like three four pieces a day there's a violin out here all right yeah no it's great to meet this great story and uh keep fighting it yeah for sure yeah keep fighting yeah i'm great i'm cool cool all

it's very good so we do the pizza reveal take you guys right here on the street huh yeah yep right on the street one bite one bite you take one bite to score it they got the oil on it the chef by the way there's been a lot of things that's been happening so frankie called and they had a miscommunication and then like we can't make pizza they mentioned my name like nope still can't make pizzas like well we got bon jovi coming they got cooking when we drop your name a little bit all and you're very particular with your pizza right yeah so you go zero through ten we'll go i don't know which one of you guys want to go first i wasn't anticipated i'll go first it's good it's good it's got a good crisp um little it's kind of a little wet on top but let's go i mean let's let's melt the cheese for you um i'm gonna go seven seven it's not hard it's cool but i think a fair score now do you know my scale it's very very hard okay what's your favorite pizza in manhattan that's a tough one i mean john's is always easy yeah that's what that's obvious and and i remember being when it was a kid you'd go to ben's it was pretty good this is pretty good it's pretty good have you guys had little frankie's yup pretty good yeah that's a that's a good restaurant same room as this yeah yeah it's good they got good time for them this is really good that's like i'm good for a seven eight i think that's all i think we're in the right area i actually when i reviewed it over there gave it high again i was intimidated but i think may actually go a little bit higher than that i could use a little more crisp for it to be firm yeah i like the charcoal i like the oil i'm gonna go i don't wanna copy punch over that john seven eight is a i also i don't want to have a bone to pick with you you got two super bowl rings from patriots three it gets me i got none i tell people i got six how they do they just present practice for like he just presents you with is there anybody else not in the organization well he stole his who i have i have bob pratt on video saying it's belichick bradyport our fans love you you have you it's it's brady belichick portnoy i'm going to jail for brady i'm like i got nothing i didn't know they gave him out and are you a patriot fan or you just i know you're you're so you're belichick back one of the giants right i'm obviously a dire patriot fan so i know how close you are but i thought it was more you're like a belichick guy and if belichick went somewhere else you'd follow if if this was 1998 or 2000 i might have said uh-huh because wherever my guys went but i became friendlier with mr well friendly with mr cop in 96 after super bowl they lost the greenback and then we started building a report now he's like one of my closest friends and advisors and mentors and he's a he's a great they've been great to us crafts have been great to me i've told the story so i i was they last super boy one they were dragging me out the nfl because they hate me in a patriot crowd circle they call the crowd you were in atlanta i've been in the mall i well in atlanta i was actually in jail i got pulled out i was in jail in the stadium oh my god because i'm banned what'd you do so i i handcuffed my me and four guys handcuffs ourselves to each other at nfl headquarters when tom brady got suspended for deaf play game so that started a long thing but the crafts have always had our back um and yeah i mean you're a huge football guy right you tried to buy the bills we're trying to name the stadium the bills we'll see if we get that like the barcelona bounce house oh no fooling yeah what's that going for 20 25 way less i was sure because yeah but what you tried to buy buffalo i did so there you go last question yeah i got well it's actually come on joey i'll come back to you uh i guess quite great to do a q a by dave right now this was a this was a debated question living on a prayer honest answer we had two different where does that rank and all i'll start with you where does living on prayer rank all-time songs all time ever made any song that's too much it's a great question though i mean when it plays does it make you feel good every time everyone knows the first beat yeah i'm saying all time songs off the top of your head don't worry that he's standing right here yeah i mean i'd put it top 20 somewhere i had to talk 10. i had a top 10. i was this guy hit top five when it plays at a karaoke bar people get tight well when it plays this patriot game the entire statement i know and the weird thing is it's a very new jersey or rival song no it's not it's a universal timeless song it is bigger than me it's bigger than pop culture i would say it's everybody but jersey shore is i think they they punch you in the face if you said it was any if you're like no it's this that like no that's a journey i that's my vibe i think it's universal as much as i love my new jersey that's i think uh it's universal that sounds bigger than anything else and we had you here we got so sidetracked you got a new album up on joey 2020 brand new record yeah they're brand new right about joey 2020 yeah out today i love that i didn't know you saw him play for no today he did you do no you're a michigan man i am mission guy hello there we go you know a lot of work to do so yeah this has been a what what's that give me the season thank god i was ready you know i actually said if they didn't play i would they were going to be dead to me forever i was going to pick a new school so i'm glad they are we appreciate you guys doing it this is wild wild wild man thank you yeah i actually was going to eat some pizza on my way home i was going to go to next year late summer maybe really where do you guys shout out where you can't say anything don't say anything so i have to be like next year sometime and then that's the only did you know it was a hit right away definitely not no because not a lot of people watched the first season and i was in a lot of marketing i put everybody i made our entire office i'm like you have to watch the best thing on tv where do you guys shoot it um everywhere really we shooting the city well when then we shot in croatia last year we shot in scotland with the stage stuff you do here the stage stuff is in queens fantastic yeah long island city and yeah yeah did you want to do something with that wine by the way because there was a ball that is the most famous rose of the last five years are you a rose a drinker everything triggered hampton water water is the most acclaimed rose of the last five years uh jesse and his college roommate came up with it and it is outstanding it's 90 point rating every year in wine spectator the three years that it's been out what's the hampton for is that for the hamptons yeah it's a lifestyle brand but it's a french wine we need some cups i don't know if you just go in guzzles i would but you know i feel like if it was andy coven but i want you to try it because it is it's outstanding it truly it's the highest rated more than miraval more than whispering angel high spring angels are ever is that everywhere yeah so any liquor store i go in i'm gonna see that no maybe not everyone yet but we're working we're in all 50 states now here try this i guarantee you wow no matter what i said it's great with pizza come on it's very good it's really really very good so let's get into that jessie uh knows that his dad likes to drink came home with a good idea we were drinking heavily one night and one thing led to another and now we're in the wine game and we were drinking it at surf watch that one night yeah yeah is this is this great next time you have surgery is that sorry thanks for this oh thank you guys for coming it's uh kind of that was very surreal i was surreal this is truly wild because this is just walking the boat is yeah it was walking down the street i mean i'm i'm in like quarantine garb like i'm wearing rocks in like sweatpants and you you're you're looking good you're well that's because we do our we do sports advisors which is like our football show so we all dress up like we're experts okay so that's every wednesday i said it before you came to see me why is he in a suit i never wednesdays wednesday that was so strange what a weird okay so what's your feeling on our pats now i think they went super i'm so i cam newton i was sort of ingesting like mvp he looks belichick always gets the defense better during the course so i don't worry about the defense until i call this apple picking weather for the patriots right don't worry about it until kind of the season's turn yeah and he gets them going and he looks i mean julian edmond has the most receiving yards his career be honest what did you think when the trade was when he came in on a scale where's your point no i was happy with it i want to keep braiding just because of everything granted i'm just saying what cam is happy ecstatic or happy i was i was happy me too because he was injured and you didn't know and i i and from day one he said all the things he's like i'm ready to go like people are doubting he said all the right things he was obviously a beast in his prime sure but he looks what do you think the play called when i got done at the end of the game first thing i did i texted you know bill and bob and i said look i'm holding my head up hi i'm not going with the bed with a pit in my stomach i feel good i wrote i made a video as if you're a patriot fan even though it sucks they lost yeah and i bet on so it sucked but that was the most encouraging guy was it was good because the offense looks good he's just so different i will say the greatest thing belichick does there's so few coaches who just that he's an amoeba like he just creates whatever his talent is so many guys now you play this system i mean this is like it's a totally different thing new new england yeah and i'm excited yeah me too i'm super excited and i'm liking what tommy's doing too i'm watching tommy and why i missed a little more action from gronk he his body's 150 years old he's taking so many huge chances it makes my heart hurt but you know gronk is a blocking tight end he's grown getting on the ball you know i like mike evans and i think tommy's doing great he is i'd rather this is crazy because brady's the best of all time i love him i'd rather have our guy right now at this stage of their career sure yeah so i would have written that pony to the end but you know tommy i i understand why i mean drew brees looks like he's 150. again all respect to all of them from my perspective well yeah he's all over him i love him gronk he's the greatest so but i'm happy with tommy but i'm happy with the new path i i i was a little ner i'm good very excited like i legitimately think they're a super bowl threat legitimately that's great news so great news all right this was fun david wilde thanks nick yeah meet you great to meet both you guys yeah yeah big fan of both of you guys this is definitely a new york moment i was hoping at some point i'd run into you receive one of these happening and it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happened insane insane insane when he said that you would have never revealed to yourself if he didn't say it no i was gonna keep my mask on and just be like i knew you're probably

gonna do an adjustment while he does that your tie was a little too long was it 90 but another hidden from moving good dive we get tied with a little too daddy it is you Jason you need a bull pen on

gonna write the pizza and then I want a ranking of me okay strictly on a look hug time yeah out of 10 both out of 10 one part ever those ones here pretty good Frankie by the way the pressures off because the owner I thought you called ahead he knew who we were he's like give me the score when he come back in so that always makes it look at the crowd you guys everywhere you go oh that fancy what do I think you asked semolina on the flower gives it a nice little sweet crunchy crust which is delicious just the right amount of oil there aren't insane pools of it because this place is chic it's part of Italy so it's while we expect I would have gone a little more aggressive on the basil but the cheese is nice and creamy but has just the right amount of full the sauce could be slightly Tangier take it away no I was amazed do we leave that one out of ten one out of ten that was an amazing review by the way it's an eight for me now we can go decimal points I'd like to walk uncommon goes round I say rookies score but it's an eight I go eight point five because the crust is so incredibly important and they have perfected it is having a faster line that's I said about the possible food issue what's your favorite Beach place and a half you have one I mean you sound like bro ah lil frankie's does a really good pizza Bianca which is a bit of local robiola Lombardia today's creamy delicate cheese I'm like a thin focaccia with a bit of truffle oil it's been indelicate not a traditional pizza but that's what I'm thinking up Frankie's got some of the best feature abuse we've ever had a Randy does a really good job to put the egg that's pretty awesome but then Mario's pizza in Clinton Hill it's like your student $2.00 slice chili flakes that shitty powdered farm sometimes that's all you want when you want to just shove two slices down yeah it's one of the most amazing pitch reviews too bad that's got the pro I think this is really good it's good I'm going seven point seven it's high it's good I hate me I give it an eight point three eight point three that I ran before you dip you haven't even given that's never even half a sublet seven a ruinous thing you've ever done no that's actually the most that that actually shows how good of a review where I lost my trans buck seven point seven eight point three eight eight and now just me I told this story with Frankie we're in Minnesota it was a Friday Minnesota we're in an elevator the door is open and the guy was right front he looked me up and down he goes whoa now I had a 10 that was spectacular straight from Nantucket and from then I've been like yeah I think that you bet so you see you walking down I want a real [Music] I walk into a gay bar with our physical physical appearance look right now right now as is yeah out of ten yeah I've let shake him you at 8.6 as close to me now I'm gonna give you a seven point five oh wow that but no these are both good on that ready good well considering like ten is Henry Cavill that's not bad no that's great right I'll take those and run to the bank with it try it I would clean up where did my slice go who stole my slice big joke I'm gonna feel about a big joke Frankie he's a good dad boy that's what you said everybody that is a good thing everyone's a dad you know how what for the dad joke I don't like we said I look like it daddy daddy daddy you know

line a lot of people say you need to try it so we reached out and they sent this the pie they sent a big time industrial pizza color they sent a hockey puck in best of all and let's see this I don't know best of all they sent it of it they sent an actual pizza oven then I had to assemble and put together today that is just to made to compete --ss now back to the story it's a little bit of a high-risk maneuver by them because they also then sent me like a DM they're like hey that oven that we set in buffers well I'm not technical it took me like 10 minutes to screw the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] llevaron but mike is it unfair to cook the pizza in the pizza oven what I've been doing all the others in my oven or do they get extra points because they actually sent me an oven to cook it and I should reward that by cooking in the oven hmm juggle juggle angel devil angel devil what should I do play fair give the own oven what do I do and then they hit me with a DM late-night and it's like just a fYI you got to cook the thing with nothing in it for like half an hour 45 minutes because it's never been used dog came by the box and it's kind of chemical smell and the pizza will suck now you roll in the dice now you take him playing craps hoping not to crap out what if I cook it first pizza ever big review and smells like chemicals but they did send the oven so I tried to clean it I tried to follow the instructions almost [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] passed out I felt like there's a chemical clamp plan planned as in plan not clan that's not a word I had to open the window I'm day trading again I'm almost just like out cold because of the oven that they sent I'm like a lot of matzo you're about to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill me I think that chemicals are gone I don't know and then they sent the letter which I read a little bit yesterday thanks for expanding your reviews into the frozen pizza world where Burton loathes food family-owned company based out of maple lick Maple Lake Minnesota

am gonna put it in the new oven I'm gonna put it in the new oven so we'll see what happens good luck - a lot of matzo I'm hoping for the best over half a pound of Wisconsin cheese let's see boys buckle up all right so I don't know how I'm gonna do this - take the pizza oven show what we're dealing with this Wisco pizza oven that they sent so there it is that looks great and let's see if we can just hand all right Pizza review time you guys just saw me take it out of the oven that they sent lots of moosa' and this thing looks [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] great and again the question on everybody's mind I already know it it's gonna be is that fair hey don't hate the player hate the game that's what I always say and will I cook other pizzas in that oven undecided you'll have to stay tuned one body by those rules flauta moots a lot of moods oh yeah I don't like when you can't see me cutting it there we go it's a little bit high one by any of the rules lot of muta Wisconsin Minnesota they sent me a puck these guys just know how to do business Midwestern nice that being sarcastic in this case it's real alright a lot of mutl and see what we got I'm hoping this is good there is a lot of moods a lot of cheese I can already tell just by touching it it's gonna be very very hot I hope it's not very chemically My Chemical Romance that's a band I don't know what they sing but I know it's a band one body ever in those rules a lot of moods who will sauce on me the back is reminiscent of yesterday and um California Pizza Kitchen very similar across the California Pizza Kitchen from yesterday I brought my home pop of the mouth that was one of the most severe burns I've dealt with since I've been doing it one by their rules lots of Musa I don't taste the chemicals at all it's that same crackery but sort of chewy dough cut know whatever they're using is the same exact crust as I feel like California good cheese I like this pizza I like the people - there's no doubt that they've influenced me I'm gonna go six five I definitely like it definitely good now I know what's calling some people because in Iowa people Midwestern people like I remember as an Iowa I'm like too much bacon in Iowa people that all look like the same like these Midwestern on how can you have too much bacon Dave Portnoy a popular blog barstool sports try to slice of the convenience stores bacon breakfast pizza and he was less than impressed okay this is too much big too much bacon impossible Portenoy ended up giving the pizza five point two out of ten and naturally many Iowans got defensive about that Iowa's stabilized for oh it's so good this has a lot of cheese and they set it right out the top it's a very thin pizza heavy heavy heavy on cheese that would be my only complaint maybe a tiny less either give me a little more crust or give me a little less cheese but the cheese the cross ratio a little bit off still very good pretty good score six five all right now on to the unboxing

yeah I don't dick around no no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around one bite ever knows the rules here we go I'm very carefully here your score I'm accumulating my score as we speak I was also telling them Frankie people who watch us are gonna either hate it or love it there's no one between us we like we like if you like box or publicly they make all best thing ever be democratic don't like okay well we can all agree that mediocre beats is bad no matter where you have it I'm giving this a 4 3 Wow and I'm starting to say that let me tell you why there's a paste eNOS to the crust and by the way I did have two bites because everyone knows the rules right but there you can still taste the flour on the bottom of the crust so I put it in and then I can't lick the bottom of it and there was literally still flour adhering and that's just it that's a taste I mean I'm not look did he literally do that you literally licked the bar I always do yeah you gotta have it slightly charred yeah put it in like this look underneath you gots it like a cat licking milk 100% Oh interesting technically you can't tell cuz the defeats are kind of close it but oh yeah look there's the tongue action underneath and there's literally still flour and I'm gonna try it again just make sure would you give it for three that is alright probably love it mildly low for this pizza my mind then you must have really high pizzas named John Pepys Penn Station that's your favorite pizza yeah with it with the sausage makes no sense that can be his number one few slices and what what would you give that just hear a thump up is I have review I would give it I mean nothing is a 10 that's like the Platonic ideal right I would give it a 9 6 no I'm serious because it's crispy the bacon slash sausage is ridiculous Frankie you know that gift where the guy's mind is blown is like this is a I'm gonna go all the way up to six point nine likes getting sexual on Tucker here but yes yes this isn't that bad I like the Soviet judge the 1980 Olympics hang out with the score that's just so disconnected from reality the rest of us are like you know what this is rigged you gave Don Pepe's a nine point second that invalidates not only this piece review but basically your entire TV wildly neck and the lights are off tonight that's why six point nine I think is fair that's too low this beats is not that bad maybe I'm a little high yo wait life I Spit on your pizza nah my dad's liquor pizza there for me to put it back all right that's kind of gross that is a review Tucker Carlson thank you

and an Allen Street so I've already done sauce well I guess your star Bobby Flay special guest this book how long's it's been available right this very second you're the first person to touch it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no I'm serious you can't go by this list I was on The Today Show this morning no now you can get it right today okay see it's happening it's available as stores yeah you kind of screwed over I don't say screwed her over but you know new show with Sophie we've done my daughter yes we've done a piece review well the fact you think everybody in the world knows who Sophie well she did Pete's review with me I mean I've done a bunch of stuff with her so that's like okay your daughter so you guys have a show as well flameless playlist that's on Thursday nights Thursdays 10:30 Food Network so there we go we got a double promo won't you have done this if so we know we've made other to horse racing become friendly I've said I actually think we'd be friends well we are friends yeah but my friends at bizarro world you're a little older than me we both like gambling just a little I've never gotten the Hamptons house invite I said we do a home in home Hamptons then talk it what do you have done this beats reviewing we weren't what you've been like partial know if you weren't friends it's a great question but I've gotten to know you so I'm totally down to do it why would it be wildly insulting at this point yeah so no urban Hawk board this is my city and so we're talking pizza we are so here's sauce now I've done sauce the slice shot I'm on nine point one on the slice plane it could have been actually a nine point two yeah different pizza this is the restaurant we come over here for a second half so are you first of all you didn't know we had a guest tape or thin y'all look at this we have a big guest explain now what the difference is before it so you get by the way you eat it this work it works give the background here what's the difference the slice shop the slice is built to reheat it so you can grab one slice this is just buy the pie and it's built for the restaurant so people can eat it it's a little bit less do you feel nervous at all of this okay because I'm pumping fear well no I'll be are I think when you probably did the most good for our top five we gave on a nine one and it I mean change you change the change the Bailey yeah so it's important and now we have a figure of voice well your report now we have a full critic Pizza critic so let's see what we got one bite ever knows those this is right up my alley in terms of defendants I got back from Rome to day zero humble brag brag little more about yeah this pizzas killer I'm understand I mean I'm a New York Pizza fish and I'm looking at this city my entire life this is really really good I love the thin crisp with thin crispy gum Brust it's not too much sauce the right amount of basil on there this is I can eat like I can't leave two of them to these pies that's the thing about it yeah they're super thin you know what it reminds me of a much better version of like the one of the Prez oh the vittle what is that oh that's what this tastes like a much better version that they have the chains that have different names but the same piece is super thin but it so in the slice shop you gave the guy at nine one I did there's a different kind of pizza know which one you like better the slice shop I like this one I do like this one a lot the sleigh shop was so up my alley it tasted like Johnson Bleeker which is like one of my favorites in the city it tastes like whole fiery vamp wasn't you have that new oven that you told me all this is very good and I like the thin you saw before I okay I like those sunglasses by the way that's very cool mascot so here's the deal tell the New York thing to do boys them to that no no definitely not I paid my way did you pay for this pizza I haven't yeah you have to pay for the pizza oh wise is not legit they try how much the pizza that pizzas twenty-two bucks it's a bargain yeah right the 2222 dot that's a far way glove $22 for this man we don't we want to make sure that we want to square this legitimately all right here so what's what's uh what's the best stories for you ever give in 94 okay what would be like eight and excellent anything over an eight is an excellent score seven is good but you don't travel for it six half so if you get the eight that's a travel piece that's how I look at it that's like you got to pack your bags and go try it this is my kind of pizza though right here okay 900 the rookies score at the round number now I know that you score well that's just how we do the game nine oh yeah I know that's a wooden spoon well any time you do a round number I say right listen you gave it nine one that's why I didn't do 900 k900 nine it's a nine it's a fairy group nine point - hash mark 904 Bobby Flay I'm gonna go good yeah killer you'll send about 20 of these to my apartment right now so good what are you thinking I'm thinking the score okay so what do you give you should give me your thought process I see you like calculating yeah I calculate because I know the score matters so I think past scores new scores where it fits what's the right number it's not so much I don't have like the acumen tofu guys like you I just go taste it's like okay this is really good but you like you like classic pizzas but you want to sit around watch sports been on games and eat a peanut right yeah well everything is different there's a different style this is I could do this is a little bit different but yeah I like the classics thinner than mostly a pizzas that you like the best I like thin I do like things but what you just said - I have a whole category football okay it's just something I'd order and then you have but you Neapolitan is not my style I think they all taste the same yeah okay give those six aids this would be more my stuff I learned ago eight three eight three who do you like better now right and the thing is identical I just white his slice don't hate some more so there's nothing I can do about it like it this would I like this I like the other morning what's happening no that's all right are you gonna like that by the way the the workout gear with the cigarette smoke the but good battle all together alright so the book is out today I saw her actually being home Bobby at home the show with Sophie and Bobby's on Thursday night's playlist playlist I think you guys want to guess the NFL and I think that yo but the NFL Thursday night stinks so

Ross I have never seen you Frankie so rattled to the point that you told me your entire diet growing up was based on what he said to eat your mum would listen to it you didn't even know half the reasons you eat in your mom would just say because dr. oz said I had to eat it I'm sure your mom never told you to have this right well actually maybe Bobby never I don't think we've had pizza on the show there's maybe a first try I want you to spin how he's is gonna keep me healthy keep me lean a lot of people I've heard people say one slice a day keeps the fat man away I don't know if that's true that's completely made up it's that Georgia I'm gonna choose to believe that's good I'm gonna choose to keep me healthy so what we do we try one a day till we try them all you take one bite one through ten and you score and also is it not make pizza I don't think this is not an egg pizza people told me we're talking earlier that you had pumpkin pumpkin spice pizza that's a thing there's that today pumpkin spice everything we make sheets this Molly pumpkin spice you know they got the little cinnamon and cloves in there nutmeg it use that nostalgic Halloween feeling is that good about are you pro I'm fought the good news is it really does remind you the good ol days I mean I'm the family and fun and faith all that stuff the bad news is you make everything he's so good you have more of it I think it's better just to have plain cheese like this n is the control you know the one first are we putting him out is you're too much grease the trip test the famous trip Tex I like this that we're pretty good the Portnoy chip test passes and no that's a really good-looking slice we haven't been on this part of town since we started these R we've done 250 are you kidding me 250 pizza Never Sleeps neither do I Upper West Side got great pizza one bite everybody knows the rules talk to Ross Frankie's knees are shaking you so nervous right now I forgot how good piece of was this has been a long time coming spin it's crunchy it holds the feeling to it the cheese could be a little smoother my mouth I don't even know what that means I believe it there's a note of mud I'm kidding that's why I have a question Frankie back to you did you make up the macadamia nuts thing or is that actually the truth he says macadamia nuts that he had his whole childhood because you said I they are so good for you they have Technion so fattening but yeah it's good that's chill out of it it basically pulls you up you won't eat too many of them so you weren't exaggerating on the macadamia nuts that's all you say you said I had Mackin em gave me enough for lunch dinner breakfast because you said so he turned it on max named it because the stuff look enemy I'm getting magazine I'm all in on macadamia pizza all right so score one to ten what do you got on this you have to finish the pizza $1 one bite right the way I just got one bite most of its missing we're gonna wrap that at it maybe maybe not I'm gonna give this I'll give it an eight there's a little bit of the cheese I would mix up a tiny bit but I think overall I've got a good mouthfeel it's got all my goood on me tastebuds long ago that this bugs I think you just dream stuff what isn't enough I don't even know when you have meat no reason you like it so much as its to noise is very ancient tastebuds primal primal tastebuds that make you just crave more of it so I get sort of get to cheese get you there I was and it's also not some time they much cheese up this is nice and pure I like to get everybody I read and that's going back to the old days the meat the primal that's your whole thing keeping it simple yeah you know if it worked for us 10,000 years ago works now fair enough I will say the eight I have to say it even though I appreciate it being on dr. oz eight is a rookie score I say that everyone who goes around the numbers because you can use decimal points I think just say I should pay attention I'm gonna give this I actually think this is really good I'm gonna go strong okay point one of us eight point one it's like The Price is Right it's exactly what you're so excited it's the best thank you so much you best pizza in the city right here eight point one more like 11 out of 10 right here all my friends every eight point one is strong they walked in this is the best pizza controlling share of the pizzeria here eight point one that's a strong review we got eight from dr. oz to probably just put them on the map in the Oprah treatment this place will probably have like thirty of them now throughout the city I do get a small cut of that 8.1 8.0 that's a review dr. oz thank you very much ah there you go enjoy"

ice cream called the LMP spunky garden hopefully it's not overrated like L&amp;B is they had their Sicilian was or their square was named after on Prince Street Freddie Prinze so I like that keep it all huge flop coming right now huge flop Freddie G's Freddie Jesus Paulie Gee's one bite everyone knows the rules leaking a little grease their little grease fire hope there's not oil down there

your go-to all right uh Pizza review time [Music] Pizza view time bread and salt I got like 19 boxes I was just figuring out why now this is this place is on all the lists like best pizzas in Jersey best pizza around weird hours I think it's what 12 to 4 you said Austin so I'm actually currently living in Jersey City for like 48 hours because I can't go back into New York City because I can't do the tax thing so it's the perfect time it's football weather it's crisp it's clang bang uh and this place by the way is awesome like the bread looks phenomenal vaguely reminds me of Angelo's bread in Philadelphia it's a little market sandwiches look awesome in the pizza actually looks great too so we got two kinds we got tomato pie in the normal uh pie also just if you plan on coming here they do say walk-ins discouraged they uh you can call ahead so I'm doing a review why would you why would you make those noises uh one bite everyone knows Rose Brent salt so the two kinds this looks like the traditional mozzarella we're starting with right here and it is Roman style which means basically if you go to Rome I have no big deal you just slice it you tell them where you want to go um see what we got I don't know how you do that those hours are insane I mean like do you have a side job or a side hustle like 12 to 4 that's it good firm let's see what we got I'm actually very excited to try this place always have been I think I've asked Austin like when can we go I always forget the hour situation so this worked out perfectly very crispy good undercarriage those kind of have that Roman style to it [Music] really good [Music] it's the bread that does it the sauce and the cheese aren't like overly distinctful but the bread is very good very crispy [Music] [Applause] Jersey City uh L7 they're just making noises [Applause] [Music] I love the texture a lot of times I end up being almost more of a texture guy than but like it's not overly flavorful but it's still great if that makes any sense [Music] yeah Chris probably just rocked your world and by the way they sell much like if you order online this is a full pie two boxes come in the store they give it half I'm gonna go eight one eight one on on the Roman and here's the tomato with the the chef with the owner or whoever that was he said this is his favorite and I'm on a tomato pie run that was around uh Trenton that area where I was just handing out eights like they grow like they grow on trees which they don't this is my guy it's more flavorful than that wow great this has more pop more kick and that's what the chef said he liked more too hmm can you hear that crunch it's like the fire engine may turn around because there's an earthquake and we're under attack that punches out this is that loud that's like a monster crunch I'm gonna go and now I'm thinking of the trend I'll go I gave that eight one eight two on the Tomato I like the Tomato more but they are kind of similar and a lot of these lists that you see we end up going I'm like oh this place doesn't belong on the list that place doesn't belong this place a hundred percent belongs to the list you have to try it right in the salt Jersey City I don't know if you work a normal job how you ever try it like 12 to 4 if you don't live around here I guess you're just screwed um but the sandwiches also look amazing so bread and salt Jersey City 8182 uh really good and everything in there looks amazing to be totally honest that's our view 12 to 4. yeah now 10 to four ten to four yeah yeah so what happens if you don't live in here you just can't ever come those are crazy hours and pizza is great by the way well thank you they make sense eventually for you yeah no I mean it's it's it's it's uh [Music] just kind of efficient and what were you doing before this how long has this place been open for three years three years so were you doing pizza before that uh yeah I had a place in Pittsburgh okay uh for a little bit I've been you know bacon bread pizza for a long time it's great stuff great stuff thank you so there it is there's the guy who owns it three years all right thank you absolutely slice down are you taping right now you just see that he was a little slice down and leave it down no I was gonna put this up Savage I was gonna put this down and then grab it it's pizza box blew open hit me in the face direct shot so we just left Ren saw doing more pizza and as you can see I love it you know I love it when I still eat it when I'm just wolf like we have five more pizza places I can't stop eating it the tomato pie and there's a million slices left so I said awesome like this these are huge and well it costs 80 bucks for two pizzas that's information I need to know Austin now is it worth it can it feed a small army

we go squared up no pressure he said his entire livelihood depends on the score he literally said that be hard on me I'm ready for it but my life depends on it that's a quote you missed it I heard it good [Music] draw my place this is a good quality solid Sicilian Square slice almost reminds me a little Detroit style and to feed like 30 people at this time burned my mouth which I didn't want to do because I want to eat at Mi nanito tonight and have the best Mexican I've ever had foreign sex like a legit seven six like a seven six anywhere you go potentially I may even gone light on him because I'm all in my head but knowing that his life depends on this is really good pizza it's really good pizza and I don't think you're gonna get anything remotely similar to this in Tucson I've already done a bunch of Tucson reviews totally different when the good Sicilian style pie tastes like an East Coast Pizza like a New York Pizza it's a really good seven six I think he's gonna be happy with it because we can tell the way I'm talking I'm not I'm not just saying that because he says life dependent on it I'm saying as a true honest man 7-6 legit score that's a review I guess I'll give him the round pie even though I want to switch with that really good really good yeah what are we doing this looks good too 72-hour fermented dough all top shelf ingredients coming from the East Coast Grande Cheese we're trying to rock it the right way it just came out don't burn your mouth up I'm gonna have to try this I know but I'll be at home very appreciative if you did you're the man I didn't want to have to do a double review I'm trying to eat Mexican now you're gonna ruin my appetite or uh beaches amazing Wildcat 83 I was gonna do the mininito bro I'm definitely gonna burn my face off I don't know how much he's charging for this this is a Monster Pizza it's huge very good undercarriage listen I I I eat so much pizza I already did a pizza review when I landed that was pretty good I had two slices came here had a little bit of that square I want to go to mindito I've looked at the menu the place literally has me tingling in places I didn't know I Tangled like it just looked so authentic I eat pizza every day I didn't want the double this this looks like I have to try did you hear him say I need you to too he needs me to he needs me the man needs one bite one bite keep it light heard

that one had a little more Tang on the sauce this had way better crisp way better cook very very good piece I'll go seven nine I like the round more than the square that's just my style so that is what I would get but they say square but the round was excellent the best I've had I believe in Tucson if I remember the others I can't remember this was this was like really really really good pizza seven nine that's our view check it out and more importantly my guy right here was telling the story that we missed so 10 months you're doing it yeah been up in uh since February 19th was our first

like intimidate me here we go see what we got wow this is tough to call how do you how do you pick one versus the other how do you pick one versus the other um well we even hear them longer so you know wait a minute they said they were there the longest they said 1914 for them 1917 for you also we uh we have sanitizer everywhere so why do they say 194. so he's saying they opened 1924 1914 why do they say and he and as grace said they wear gloves clean the bathroom floors sanitize and they just run and ramp it over there is what he said why do they say 1940s [Music] because they lie why they say 1940. i don't know man this rivalry is awesome this robbery is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome oh all right i don't know how it's possible i think the bun is the difference this one has this one's like i can eat this one easier like the last one was stronger to me and i don't know it may have been more stuff on it same stuff but like more this one i can eat the other one a little more rubbery but still good i mean i like that one he's saying that liars they're probably telling this place is the liars they're saying they don't clean this and we don't clean here literally the hatfield and mccoy's i love this rivalry the nog goes to america i like the american more than lafayette i can eat it easier i don't know it helps describe it the other one felt thicker and more like you don't love the ingredients you're gonna struggle with it more neither of them to be honest would be the first thing i'd ever eat they're both heavy they're both strong they're both like i'm gonna bet on sports tonight i'm just gonna be sitting like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but what a rivalry this is the greatest rivalry in all sports all the hot dogs unbelievable love it little brother yeah what's up man how's it going nice meeting you thanks for everything man that's awesome dude i'm glad we could help awesome we appreciated that yes we went into lafayette they gave us their story we came here he's just like that lion yeah no and they are because the funny thing is you know my grandpa right up there he started everything back in 1917. you know uh he came from greece at 19 and then like everything else my everyday's family came he brought his brother over in 1920 and his brother got an argument in 1924 lafayette wait say that last part again so like every immigrant family he brought his brother over from greece in about 1920 1921 and uh working the business doing all this stuff him and his brother got an argument and his brother opened up lafayette coney how has that not been mentioned till you just said i keep asking i didn't know they were related yeah well hold on that's a kicker though so that was in 1924 lafayette my uncle george sold laffy at coney island in the 90s to a group of investors so it's no longer family owned or operated it's not you know all this stuff it's a rivalry because it's like you know the hatfields yeah what they've been saying happy holidays all day yeah that guy said he's worked there over 40 years yeah he has but different owners now yeah he used to work for my uncle george and now he works for someone else so but that's the best but that's why you know everything like we're still family owned and operated from you know my sister runs the hell out of everything now so but yeah i [Laughter] thank you you're welcome i'm glad we

regular i mean that in a complementary way but it is heavy it is i look at all the oil all over it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] legend i'll take that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] legend put that quote [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] legend quote um how many slices in this let's do the math here one two three four five six you almost need six people oh come on through um you almost need six people eat it because it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] heavy it's very good but it's very heavy the oils the basil the whole works i gotta go back in there he's gonna be like what'd you score it seven three there's a one slice place i know one slice i'm going back to the hamptons i'm going to take my shirt off one slice one slice only so heavy people who know me i like regular pizza not on regular pizza i like football pizza it's good but it's just real heavy 7.3 on regular let me go get the roman style give this guy a shot fancy fancy fancy pants i'll sell you in the fronts before yeah i eat a pizza everywhere you're gonna come right through so there we go there's the roman style and this is your spot right yes it's my spot where were you before this uh i was in chelsea market working as a manager okay and then uh during the pandemic i started making pizza at home all right they bought their pizza with other people i like that oh yeah so this is your that's the that's signature signature slice like that if you like he says it's not it is fancy one bite see what we got i'm not pepperoni guy or veronica guy on my pizza but we'll see i mean this is lunch and dinner one slice yeah that's the whole meal basically yeah yeah like the crunchy it's very good it's not my style because i like it as basic as possible this is unregular i can feel the pepperonis in my throat right now it's just what type of pizza are you looking for are you trying to get like an all-american slice are you trying to go to rome and italy and have it on regular if you're doing that give this a shot i do double seven threes on it it's very good it's just very very oh they gave me the still president it's i like the tag it's an experience this is an experience eating almost sit down fork knife type vod but if you want a unique slice this is as unique as you'll get the pizza may be parted with the people you love yes you can party with someone else if you like or anything else like how you trade like the shirt off their back or a slice you mean anything you like everyone want to trade anything for a slice of pizza yes what can you trade me oh smile i'll take that that's a deal but you got to bite it and score it i already took a bite of that one so these four and it's from one to what ten you still owe me the smile one bite yeah only one like you know the rule there it is you know one bite and i'm making this thing yeah i still haven't gotten a smile that you trade for it do you want some shoes for a slice yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah i don't wanna put my hands yeah i'll take them which one should i buy one of these two i know that one looks better to me um on your rating yeah 7.0 7.0 rookie scores rocky what about you four flat numbers by the way i just got some frap rose sneakers out of this deal seven four seven four all right there it is all right yeah and i got peanuts so there you go and this is the only one left though the chicken what is that slice chicken chicken like i said buffalo chicken mozzarella all

Park right there's a famous building that is that I don't like basketball West 3rd part whatever we're round a corner from there they play basketball there we were noticing something in there they're huge on Napoli like Napoli pizza this that vitac Naples yeah like it oh that's it all right they got married honest [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hangin left and right like his uniform sign [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] very confused because that that's Argentina apparently soccer yeah but Italy's big oh yeah I know I'm all over the place but I know this Italy has good soccer too yeah they got their own thing yeah so what's up with you're gonna be so Pro Italy me me root for Italy maybe the guys that own the place are earning yeah you know it feels like you know they're capitalizing on the whole Italian yeah that's what I'm I hear you Argentina because I'm Frank your pizza guy do they make pizza in Argentina that's right yeah it's probably worldwide a little bit I'm kind of on both sides here's how we do it now we take one bite and you give a score zero through ten one by one by two then a score we try a different place every day in Manhattan I mean I actually Inessa Telenet I was telling him on the way over shoutout to SNL and in case you never heard that little show right so the coolest thing I've done in New York so far it's seen the show saara Julia Louie Dreyfus is the house amazing yeah sure it wasn't she great all right so one bite don't burn yourself it's hot my fingers are like burning on the bottom Dan will sold a brick oven in this guy he's looking as I gonna build brick coming to my house two minutes it took for this max floppy little New York flop a little bit of a fancy net Argentine style one bite using much is yeah I'm losing it till you're gonna burn yourself mom by everyone's rules score go to town that's it like that's a solid eight eight point five that's a solid eight man now I can eat the rest oh yeah it's good pizza it is good like fresh ingredients the cheese is so fresh like crust look at them I love it you're getting on this get that crispy do you like this or a football ah this is football pizza more like this is this fancy you just sit now maybe like give me like delivery time yeah yeah look what's your favorite pizza viewing this is like a thin crust pizza all right good is that the one that it's the change is that the same as topo and possibly a terrible yeah I guess they specialize in thin first with insulin is possible credibility element but yeah yeah you know I mean yeah if you care about your life I I gotta give this is a oh I always keep it real I don't know seven point seven oh snap can I ask why the point eight and deduction well it's like a figure skating thing it's it's you do one of these every day's done like 150 of them yeah so if you're just doing one through ten I mean then you gotta run out of scores I noticed it was landish the pizza well then but you gave an 8.5 that would contradict your score but the ingredients are so fresh and the cheese is so fresh and it dough is nice and light as opposed to super thick and a little bit super white so that's why I gave it so yeah this is like a knuckle but you're going all over the place on me right it's like round three is like great land yeah so I'm asking you is that why you gave it yeah I like it I like it I know this Pizza generally doesn't have the firmness yeah my favorite favorites coal-fired I like you crispy like I like when I want to hold it he doesn't have a huge flock to this did it's a different type of pizza it's very good that's a sauce thing right too much sauce I think it's this they turn it into 20 questions it's like jeopardy now I don't mean you got me out yeah what if I did y'all just true it's a fair question I think it's the spot like this is what I call fancy pizza right I guess it always sort of yeah so she ate that with heat I think so so uh I don't think it's bland though I just agree with that assessment okay I mean Kenan Thompson steamed pizza on the street clap that you don't like I feel your clock I don't love New York Walker I hear you very good how would you yell oh sorry next to miss Lily's down there to Jamaica joint you know what I said I also don't like the yellow sign I feel like it should be red is that an Argentina thing like I don't know they're all party yeah I don't know like when I think of time Pizza give me the rent give me the green give me the flat yellow I've driven by this place a lot from over here no part of the Italian flag is a business doing that on hooks the pizza is that that guy's name is ezel the guy I know that is there Napoli in Argentina are we sounding dumb now am i sounding don't no I don't think you sound dumb but I guess I know that would be quite the boy though the matter if there was like just saying you live in Naples but it's like an Buckland or something right alright I think that's a rude so eight point five you know he said his plan was a little weird I'm seven point seven the captain Ray Bourque good pizza I won't turn it down very good beef by the way for me that's a very high score anything over 7.0 I think's pretty good yeah all

yeah oh yeah it's so they saw this this is this is what we call in the pizza business slash show business a call back this is the same pizza that I believe we call garlic bread last time oh yeah right all right one bite everybody knows the rules and what what cut what's this called not Detroit style this is still pizza the other one definitely wasn't me again not like it is not what I would order I do like it way better than the other one I'm doing the same exact thing it's a double eight point one if this is your style pizza you could go higher than April one I can see how people would really love this but again pizzas so weird it's hard to compare this whole fire anything this is its own unique category of a super deep deep deep slice now Frankie last time we went to the other place I made you try it because I was like it's so bad Frankie you have to try it to make sure I'm not just exaggerating so you tried the last one and crucified it let's reverse and I tried the other slice which I gotta say I would have no no first lesson you just review he gave me point one I would have given like an eight point seven that was my type of pizza we just talked about sub camera that's not your time style pizza I would eat that meat a like a lot what he said so in there he's feeling like okay so he has the garlic cloves he's got the fresh heart off the trees he's clipping the tree the parsley he's got a missile Miyagi yeah the grandmothers probably in the back stepping on Tomatoes it's the whole deal he also has his own video camera which [Laughter] what I tell is this is like yeah yeah what you want you gotta give it a score though you take one bite one tag real quick you got just a mess in there one through ten ten you can't do that that's like ten dominoes in eight dominoes that is true where these Domino true words and that may never have says and behind it up you all right Domino's is better than that's what she said yeah tough to swallow all right back to the pizza those are not pizza people because you don't give a damn you know you don't give a 10 right away I'm not gonna give you a 10 I can read each other just please give it 10 yeah I can already see that this is a little thinner than the other one which I like it's not it's not a mess and you're not you're not chewing a pillow last time we were chewing fluffed the pillows and I hated it with a load of garlic for that [Music] this is more of like a little bit bigger of a Sicilian slice of pizza I really enjoy this a lot better it's the same amount of dough as the grandma that you just had it's the same weight of duck no no no we're just fermenting it to that size and that's what's so hard about those pizza I don't know I haven't had Tommy's over there Ivan Atta he's a good friend of mine we went to a Rangers game recently together but uh how ago I invented this thing now for nothing really and truly but he knows that that's the whole thing he hasn't been dead against the other pizza guy it's I feel bad for the other pizza guy I tried to edit my badness out of that last review because I felt so bad about saying I feel great about what I said about that this is an 8-point bot for me yeah I had the other one around like an eight point six as an eight point five this is I could eat this pizza the other one I couldn't need if I enjoy Shou we went to a ranger game for I saw a loss henrik lundqvist most overrated hockey players in history the game that's a review of"

like a hundred dollars and we're eating pizza so yeah it did okay we're gonna taste this Pizza we also got big announcement with him come once it Frankie Wednesday and lay this well that chain I think they call that ice think that me this is ice blue ice is ice right yes ice right they call it that's what it is it's pretty hot why don't you go the scary Terry still get that custom-made does that custom mate yeah this was custom-made she was scary to her all right here's what we do we try it one bite you score a zero through ten and you give it a score by the way Youngstown Ohio guy and we're doing rough and rowdy Youngstown Iowa having a broom here check it you keep saying I like that check you know was that just me calm before you go okay check it I wonder what sir that's the case with the problem they don't do that no well you must be the king Netflix right something like all right so you guys you're struggling here majorly what he's trying to get some lady in the trip going but I'm not about to do that I actually would do that now view funny review not I mean scary charge it's a sucking face there doesn't that way I am that to a lady in the traffic all right so you take one bite and give a score zero through ten put your bear pits in Boston you have one don't send Tokyo's original life lesson one bite of rhinos rules [Music] what can't the guests every beats a Frankie it's a simple thing if God made a mockery this I'll tall are you by the way don't want you to be dogs we blow our surprise every time they see us like okay it's taller than will get me because you don't have about that much taller than me I mean I'm clearly not taller they're saying you're not that much taller I'm 6 3 all right in the summer 6 2 they're in a season all right so then I'm 6 what you know what I was wondering too Frankie do you think I can get a rebound in an NBA game if I played the whole game do I get one rebound no chance I think I could I mean if you miss a three like you missed a bunch of them in the fourth quarter I'd be camped out there the top of the key wait for the long rebound that's how I get my own rebound well if I put a body you're not happy I get to bust throw you out what do you got I got I got a I got a rating for this this is easily 25 our disagree with that score this pretty good pizza that's a pretty bad score I'm actually on some point too I think it's pretty good pizza not five pots walkway to what's best oh you know yo sound also says there's a pizza kappa they say everything they said did the pizza capital world your parent Pete sun-young that's a lot Valeria we did that right that's why by the read oh yeah that's like the fixing I threw out of the reader yeah that was a super heavy thick pizza Bellary a one bite everyone knows the rules it's thick it's it's heavy it weighs 62 pounds one bite ever in those rules yeah also Louisville legislate Louisville and a couple of my town so that's a review five five we got a big announcement coming with you and by the way I'm Eric weenie Golden State's of smash Cleveland are you watching the finals we just get sick watch no I don't ya see I'm watching it just to root against LeBron but if they get swept I can live with it regardless our future is bright brighter than most people watching it that's where even five five stare we get swept our game seven will be forgotten right it doesn't hurt his back they can't win that one game if they win if Cleveland wins even one game in my game seven back how long did you sleep on that games like I didn't you know when the LeBron and one goaltend play he came over into my thigh was sitting on the court you didn't say hello once that's fine I was sitting in the corner courtside he walked over me to eye contact when screamed in my face that's what the only business partner and I'm getting streamed now at LeBron which I never thought would happen I can't have it no 79 points can't happen for whatever that's good it did happen it can't happen about what I give it four five five you can't change it this concoction give it a five seven I got a little bit better it's a wild change right there that you can that's illegal but if you're gonna try to make a change make it I get these two full points what did you get seven two are you in the chain that's right defender goes the roof why can't we put more time on the clock after we always what's up nine points who says the rules oh all right look I can't leave the bench in the NBA those are the rules no Haley you can't compare this city this is probably it is probably more important I agree eating food was more for ya you talk about food let's get this straight I'm just hungry right now this is a so it should be even a higher score than if you're on at the end of the day I still gotta taste it I think it's pretty good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we try new plate everyday I'd never had no this is this is seven - it's not bad but concrete alright that's it this guy's ray I he's my guy so I don't wanna let him keep changing scores by one decimal point that's where we cut them cut it where we're done with this one you talked about game stuff

1028,Pizza Review - Pugsley Pizza Jon Taffer,ZTQJKyB4CQ8, [Music] all right Frankie we are in Brooklyn Pugsley pizza Bronx we're in the Bronx we're not Brook 'ln we're in the Bronx they both thought would be outside of Fordham Pugliese pizza Jon Taffer we got a bunch of things happenin Frankie first of all congratulations Jon Taffer the first two-time guest what are you shaking your head are you coming down and no you want us to come down why did we look weird up there just open your mouth tell us we're not minds you want speak up man he got me a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] producer if you wants to come down he's just smiling if I didn't ask you we would've stood up there you interrupted my whole thing I'm about to say this the first what now what were the first two time pizza review guest ever we talked about it he earned it he deserves it he's actually carrying the pizza they put we've never had it come out on one of these trays before either it's always in a box we met the owners we met everybody that John generally [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with me because then it's like I know him and I don't want to crush him in a review thank you will oh if I'm nothing it's because I'm true so it doesn't matter that they're the nicest guys been there from 1985 we're hitting the gong we're doing all this stuff [Music] here we go they're very excited they're fans we met the old man he loved my beer does not matter yeah beer why are you guys that I do this stuff well I look better with I look uglier without it the truth is in the pie you're the best of describing it what do we got here what are your thoughts well first of all clearly hand-tossed much nicer crust than last time doesn't have the dryness look at the sauce on the outside look at the color of that cheese it's beautiful the Browning of the cheese shows shows the realness of the cheese this is a big cheese I love the fact that you see some of the green oregano in it you don't often see the green calling a pizza like that we don't have too much bubbling which is great I like bubbles I know you do but look at the we can see some flex in the crust so we know it's an stuff it doesn't have that honeycomb that we talked about last time so let's just start with our consistency you like the flop I don't like the flop but a lot of pieces I generally like the cold fire but it has a good plot doesn't mean I won't like the pizza I generally like it crispy now you notice there's no oil drip which is beautiful which is beautiful if this was fake cheese right now we'd have that oil dripping down from the pizza so that's a really good statement equality when we see no drip like that no grease fire I love it right we have no honeycomb in the dough cuz it was hand tossed so it's flopping so you ready I'm ready let's give this a shot I'm gonna fold it you're not of course this is how I do it when they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] depends on each slice slice slice but you hold on since this is the second Pete review we've ever done together cheers buddy Cheers one bite everybody knows rules we have Pugliese in the Bronx not Brooklyn the Bronx one by every nose rules now also John so this is a big late-night place at Fordham my experience is when you say late night college kids means I won't like the pizza because it's like drunk pizza yeah not saying that's gonna be a case here but that's what the word ministry was okay so my first bite when you bit you felt some crunch did you mm-hmm the consistency of the dough is perfect had the softness and I have that crunch in the bottom how many [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bites you're gonna take here one bite everybody knows the rules so that little slice is a bank okay so I got one bite he gets 35 bites so we had great consistency what do you think of the shoes I didn't see is very good excellent some of the best we've ever had though is really good the sauce is excellent look at the chunks of tomato and that sauce showing the freshness they're clearly making it in-house so this is we always able to pick the chunks of tomatoes off like that you should if it's a real sauce yeah also if it's a raw sauce as it should be the tip the tomatoes stay intact so you look we got pieces all over this pizza so you know it's fresh sauce we know it's good cheese the dough is a great consistency this is a far better pizza than we had last way better I'm giving this and this is a high score for me you ready I'm ready eight point eight Wow that's a very high score that's a gigantically high score which the highest I've ever done is nine point four really so we're up in do you agree it's a great pizza I think it's very good pizza eight point eight on my scale is a little bit strong I think it's very good bite nine right now I'm gonna go captain Ray Bourque seven-point-seven Wow you have a whole point one gap between them oh yeah so does this mean that I'm more forgiving about pizza I just think I've done 350 of them over 350 days it's like figure skating if you go that high you're gonna find stuff you like more you gonna run out of the numbers so when I'm doing this everyday I how many nines have we given Frankie and the last out to be under 10 I mean it's a pretty good score though oh boy seven that that you can say washa that's a good score so if you just showed up how are you gonna come here not even telling me that you're are you for real right that's guy this guy alarmingly stupid that's his nickname because he is he's alarmingly stupid dizzy he works for us he yeah were you like yeah I didn't believe it you would come here to my turf and not even tell me about the beautiful place well what do you think of this I can't believe we didn't tell Tommy smokes out of the club how'd you find out I was here I was getting dm's messages like no way they come here and not tell me my fellow team Portenoy guys no way this is good back I'm gonna go 7.2 he was I went pretty high on it I went pretty high with an eight point eight well but I'm gonna tell you something if you in a neighborhood you would come here for this pizza with you yeah this is well there's the best pizza I would not you would not know that's why you stay out of the way that to me is like 20 plus minutes to come get no no would you drive 10 minutes to come here depends what else is round okay so the fact of the matter is this is just above average pizza if there's nothing else I will drive for good pizza I'd have to know what's around me like my favorite pizza place in Manhattan is walking distance to my place so the fact is since you moved to New York two years ago you become pizza spoiled well again 350 amaya the standards up but if you had 350 peaches in Boston and 350 pizzas in New York would be better well oh come on no I'm telling you New York has more crap Pizza much more better Street pizza there's just so much of it you'll find better pizza but a lot worse so I Boston would be my answer is just better on every scorecard of every every category known to man and that is what happens when you only take one bite I disagree I think New York wins and pizza you guys win in lobster rolls but this is a good pizza this is a good New York Pizza I come back to this place that's a review Jon Favreau first time and Tommy smokes look at that zoom no zoom in zoom in on how Tommy smoked look at this guy alarming when you miss your mouth rain and snow it doesn't even realize it's all over his face all over his face that's a reveal

corner of seventh and third third thank you uh and this pizza looks great now we were late getting here so we put in a second pie they re-cooked it the waitress brought this out she did not close the Box veteran Sly Savvy move because when you close the Box the pizza loses a little so this box really hasn't been closed and if you're just looking at this thing from the outside looking in it's beautiful like that's a beautiful looking pizza so we've had an unbelievable run on this trip in Brooklyn what have we done today we did uh baby Luke's great lucali Luigi's which blew my mind a little tang and then um Bay Ridge no Grand battle station which wasn't but this I know this looks great so one bite ever knows the rules see what and also the guy making the pizza knew who I was so I know he was like putting every inch of effort into this but it looks it looks spectacular if we're being honest and it's very firm good undercarriage right up my alley I don't want to burn my face off see

mind uh ladies and gentlemen if you will look right here hmm a great pizza just great pizza eight two maybe it could have been eight three I'm getting confused I've had so many great pizzas today I

Downtown Manhattan you won't be able to get in right now eight two great pizza highly recommend Lombardo's of Bay Ridge and there's a lot of lombardos floating around I don't know if they're all related or whatever but this one's fire this is the best Lombardo's I've ever had Lombardo's the Bay Ridge 8-2 and if anything I was hard on it I'll give this one a try to the the traditional margarita I assume he thinks this one's better because he led with it it's crazy what a difference close in the Box makes it's very hot I feel that cool for one second one slice I've never heard it called that one bite foreign they're both very good excellent pizza eight two I did my job it's a great picture my man and how long have you been here for now these really is a Lombardo's really

everything myself beautiful spot to get all the inside great stuff you're not all gonna helping us tremendously hopefully this review I mean this is really really good stuff we've been pretty cold but I mean we get some people that come in and we've been busy but the colder killed us I got a crypto man you can stake there's guys that are staking it right they lock it up for 30 days and they're getting paid interest on top of that and that interest is like I mean you made ten thousand dollars you crypto guys all have a story you can't tell one crypto the next crypto guys gonna be like if you take this and you'll hold it for 10 minutes it's gonna be worth 10 million dollars in five seconds well can I show you what I made in I believe so I have November November of 2019. what's up what's up man so November of 2019 I got in I paid maybe 1500 to get into this yeah it's called hex it's the it's the top three crypto all right someone just tweeted at me yeah you were coming they did yeah so that was me that was me I was trying to tell everybody I wanted to tell you about it so you're saying 15 grand with the 2 million is that what you're telling me yes it's too good to be true top three cryptocurrency and you get in I got in in 2019 or November yeah you got an ollie that's great no but it's still going up I mean this thing if you want to look at you are you a chart guy no you're not a truck guy neither am I but if you just hold on to it it just goes up and then it just gonna make you can make tons of money you ain't got to worry about looking at it every day what would hurt you if you just bought a little bit if I bought every Bitcoin that someone told me to buy I'd be sleeping on a garbage bag of useless Bitcoins everybody every every girl is this book when that Bitcoin this Bitcoin you go take a stand somewhere you can't have all the Bitcoin [Laughter] yeah yeah man good luck to you thank you and you met you know congrats I mean you are early you're smarter than me I'm late I missed Bitcoin this is this is a better Bitcoin this this Bitcoin I know I know I know I know trust me do you know how many people pointed out though this Bitcoin is not proof of work this Bitcoin is proof of stake so it's a it's just a whole bunch of people you could be right the problem is I've gone the same pitch from a thousand people on why their Bitcoin is better than Bitcoin Nick everywhere you go someone's got a Bitcoin yeah but this one this one I know but uh how do I know I know but everyone says that though yeah Bitcoin it's a different one you might what if I send you something and you just hold it what is that gonna do everyone does that because they want me to talk about it no I don't want you to talk about it I didn't I'm not Shilling into so that you can go and talk about it I'm just hey man I want to send you some and if you hold it I don't even know how to accept it how does it help you it well it look so it's just like any anything else right you're looking for the next person to come in and buy over the topic right it's even with apple water anything because that's how you make money you you want the next person to come and buy the next price that that is kind of like a pyramid yeah that's pyramid pretty much the definition of pyramid but isn't that with everything though so no not necessarily let's say you buy Coca-Cola shirt yep okay what do you buy in Coca-Cola shares for well theoretical performance of the company so the performance of the company wait so you you appreciate sugary drinks and you want them to you want them to succeed making more money well you want yeah you want them to be profitable right so so yeah how is that but that's based on me buying the drink but how is that any different from yours yours your what you just described it the price is going up on more people buying it not not the product crypto guys one of them thank you

special guest piece review we're at his place we're at Foxwoods where it guys and I got to get the exact pronunciation guide fares Foxwoods kitchen and bar you guys don't have pizza here from nice good you can't get dat right Gary Fieri Giganta you butch beach away Gogi study go study wait how did you say I said it the way to Azusa which is your name be Eddie get free early art fee no fee there's a guy named Eddie Eddie he's got to pay a fee fee Eddie oh they're gone never had that we've learned that we've learned that it goes on what's an East Coast that I should now he's our chief of iego yeah yeah how many times you got out here good to sum up exactly Yeti were you from I'm from North Shore yeah this whole thing yeah yo fast I don't know me we're gonna do pizza the real way all right so pizza you guys don't serve it here we're gonna do a special burger review after but I'm a piece of guy okay by the way do you ever get jealous because you know all the places you're going to diners drives and generally don't have pizza right I don't know a lot of Pizza oh really yeah really Oh bro you're not watching our shows you'll tell me that a Thunder has great people I'm not saying they say it's not just diners no it's not we draw bottom beats it matters big peach about effect I've been to Pete's drive-ins but no pizzas a lot we we love Pete's on Triple D okay so well then there's a yourself with me right here Judah sure you have your own chair I generally stand you stand with me will you I finished in with you sure would be better okay yeah you can sit or stand we're pretty laid back however you want to do it I'll get my lunch handed Peter this alright here's what we do this Regina I don't you don't you have not even tell me what we're doing on the tongue right now we take one bite of this pizza okay and then we give the score zero through ten now this Regina which is renowned as one of the two best places if this the same torpedoes in Boston that's not to say char pou can't give Yeti Danny Bennett I've gotta send toffee there's a million times so I have that now I down hard time so it's one bite score zero through ten one bite everybody knows the rules that's how we do it okay Guy Fieri now that's right theory oh you ripped it it's on savage move one bite for Regina from Fox also do you think account that this is they have restaurants everywhere does the scores matter if you're in different places is this is this an all-encompassing Regina score in your mic well how many routine is rather odd at least 10 or 15 I mean one of the North that one byte score you go first no the gas goes goes for the guest always goes for always and it's one through three no 1 through 10 1 to 10 oh yeah no that'll be wild I'd give it a being that it's not right out of the oven neutral out though let's go dog one that I just put on you yes ok yeah this is a really interesting event I've never I've never in my restaurant eating somebody else's food where we're standing and then in the pure wood and we're going burgers not to work it's alright we don't have to I have time to make an antelope so gosh I love pizza I gotta say I think it's got good crust I think it's got it's got a lot of crust it oh really it's light on the sauce but it's also light on the cheese you need any money where I'm getting it I'm not getting a lot of cheese maybe up here under maybe up here in the North End I didn't get a lot of cheese I'd have to give it a and are we in this style a feature are we in my spectrum of the world of feature cuz I'm a Neapolitan pizza character in the world spectrum of the world up but I mean you do it goes obviously different kinds of pizza right you take I'm just taking this as this type of feature I thought we we're providing it I call this football kids love course we call this New York City pizza oh gosh they're fit now while I live in New York because New York style it's not what which thin you folded the paper plate the whole giddyap we don't let me know about football people eat it during football I'd say I would give this to I'd give this to an even a five and a half five point five it's a super low score for Gina we've just playing football which I which I don't again you're in you're asking a guy that has a wood-fired up in his backyard makes his own pizza and that's that's a lot of you know so it's just but what I eat it how to eat the whole thing all right it's a professional story or professional food guy I'm going to go but I'm not gonna take into account it wasn't straight out of the oven that always hurts a pizza I still thought it was pretty good for for the it's at also by the way for like seven minutes so I am going to be hundred seven seven to nine how'd it get here they walked it over the places in Foxwoods okay so 79 yeah 79 minutes and what I'm going to do is attract two decimal points I'm going to give it a six point four again I think that's kind of a strong score considering the circumstances but we have a star you make it work the star you come here we didn't go to direct out of the oven so that's a review by tu today home bites that's a home bite score I'm not listen a crusty dynamite cup put that a little-known fact put a dual language has a switch at the mission went to machine got to switch on my school because I can happen to less [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah no don't I don't get these are cozy everybody butchers or I don't have any problem with that what are you talking fun when you start you get right micro nice try put me on my back feet and get right I get it going to leave it that's a silk yeah I know I put five six point four I think it's here's a great thing about it how much was it the pizza yeah I'm going to guess the pizzas like a full pies Carly 20 bucks that's a wild yeah 15 bucks you know I think I mean this is your show and you definitely got to go and people are definitely paying attention a new casino a big casino yep to be able to get a pizza like this scratch made homemade and make quick with this type of integrity to the crust then when you put your criteria in there it might rate it a woman higher because you're not just talking about somebody's randomly spinning out frozen pie drops right you guys are doing something so I would have to say that it might get a little bit higher than that but it again it's really difficult cuz my mindset is I go right off to the apology pizza where I'm going with you know double zero flour and full of mozzarella a horizontal tomatoes and all that kind of 12 yeah trying to big time you know so it's I don't ask intro don't ask me how to spell it okay cuz I will spell it wrong every time what did you think Frank Frankie's in town guy's family has a pizza place how would you pronounce his last name do you have it right by the way little guy you are at our Super Bowl party you come abroad his Twitter profile before he knew was YouTube like kissing on the cheek that's fast it was me kissing him on the TI exaggerated but it's a nice little purple here the whole works this guy's on fire huh that's on vmm a coffee 5.5 by the way you can't change the score around here so it's five point five six point four dots are a few all right so bonus my name is a four nine you are at Burger thoughts guy fieri now we're getting into your face still daunted can you do it when you do burger Duffy you give it something like this I mean maybe give it a moment yeah we're good you can shake hmm yeah yeah give yourself a little pause over yeah yeah my hair c'est pour TOI and we are doing burger fox defense be back Elvin one AC collect enough neutrons were cold and then the guy hear it how's that cut it out better alright so what is this the Colby perfect you are out of control it's true that you gave it a suggestion we're gonna do the same thing a one bite burger review got out you can get this here so again we're at your spot how do you get here where you come from by the way to go there we gonna whole East Coast Swing a legit I was just in Philly and I flew in to come get to hang out and then I got a bounce down to Boston tomorrow I'm doing a gig with with Julian and Brady for Best Buddies oh got a couple things going on alright so uh Kobe beef burger sharp cheddar brioche bun crushed a little bit of garlic butter with Dom in the sauce on there let's see it alright one bite same thing by the way I won sort of blog on how to hold the burger and neither of us it's like a clog or at this [Music] is the fall really solid garceau same thing one bite got to give it a review I got everything in there yeah because the I took a little mouse bite in there but I will I agree with you it is I don't there's a big napkin burger that's a big guy hey are you oh wow it's a bed sheet also awesome hi nobody go first oh yeah so I really think that the I really think that the fun is on point I do think that the analogical maybe of course you like the the Wagyu beef in Scott who it's got a great fat content to it cooked medium rare I dig all that forever good amount of tea nice amount of donkey sauce I do think it's a little wet and that kind of detraction with a bit and I think is lacking a little bit of salt so in my opinion of my own burger at my little burger your own rough that I that I did make I would have to give it a I didn't gotta have to give the burger how did you give her the burger in 82 and 8 - I'm sure what's going on thank you good back I'll give the burger don't put the part in there me cleaning him up definitely put it in there I'm gonna give this burger a 9.8 is my first burger review you know what that is pretty I'm telling you what we got to have more burger reviews with him the burger is cooked perfectly I am questioning what's going on surprise is it just a mishmash of every Friday great question I'm glad you see this what happened you call the Sidewinders a little more of a steakhouse life now your traditional [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] these are quite shoestring but in that idea you've got the waffle cut fry and you should have a print will cut but they must not like us but the idea is this you don't get these many prizes want any more right they're not the healthiest tray for you I mean you're pretty lean in me and you have to Adelman shirt on and all and show you I know this year you know you work it out to this I'm on a special well evidently I mean you're a trained professional and you can I can see that but the reality of it is if you're good eat fries might as well have a little variety to cut up some nice stuff of it huh well this one's a good burger I really do like what we did hundreds of the couple's egg didn't get above I with this burger all the time you ever come in a whip ass if it's like the restaurant you eat it it's like this wasn't very do leave it I don't have to do it very often but every once well got to like I'll do a little bit why show you but I'm gonna go in a duel over line walk through these guys here at Foxwoods you're sharp I mean these guys have this big night entertainments a really great operators are great partner to have so we're in we're in good shape with them but oh every once in a while proxy's gotta open up got open up the jar water haha alright so that's a well how did you guys get into doing this crazy house so I started I grew up in North Shore and bar Pizza that's a big I don't know if they have it anywhere but like go into the little platform nut flat right here they're tiny little personal size piece I graduates just a big debate in my area what little what places were the best so I just started doing them people liked it we moved to Manhattan like 14 months ago I said I'm going to try every place in Manhattan so i go different place every single place we do this everyday and then start going popularity so people started it just like you and it's uh taking off the life result i think what would be helpful for me is and i'm going to be a viewer now learning about is i think it would be helpful is when you have the bar of measurement you know so when you have in hot ones for instance are the year aware that you have the Scoville unit to judge by i think that in this situation like we need to defeat that if you were to say if you went to Don Antonio's in Naples and you had it made by Don Antonio himself they might be a ten right if you sat at home when you're college-going he's got in your college dorm room and you have a bad microwave that only can fit half of the microwavable tray of the toasty no pizza rolls that would be a zero with Totino's pizza rolls always a ten always a ten okay sorry sorry sorry yeah well they distract that but I'm saying in most people's mind and that's stuck different yeah and there's different cabinet or you can you aside yeah yeah and don't get me wrong you don't think that we all survive freshman year of college without so you know Pizza totally and there's also my point is if you get some more a lot of a spectrum of what it is I think it easier for people to judge I was but your food expert a lot of our guys are just small so it's not so an expert or not I think that that beats right there to me when you give it a 5/5 when I even if I might be in a 6 quart I still think that should be understood that anything of a 3/5 is great in the world of heat 3 5 2 to 7 is really that's really good pizza oh I oh yeah well we have very different spectrum we're only 5 stinks really stinks how we know is there like a it's like a finger hitting score for us like a ton of perfect ring in the 3 and a 5 yeah that she here's the thing peach is kind of like you just got like that one thing when it's good it's really good and when it's bad it's still good it's still good I agree with that I agree that let's all we're budgeting that should be a t-shirt a show we have a week all of the teachers know about the racks but that's fine no I didn't cause it opportunity at all i matter Vic just to see you rolling it is what I want does Jules know you're wearing a shirt no we're gonna surprise him on with it that's pretty good that's pretty extra yeah I got a game I appreciate

1041,"Barstool Pizza Review - Fresca Pizza & Pasta (Toronto, ON)",T7mSx9ij_5Y, [Music] okay pizza review time uh we're at fred good catch dave uh we're at fresco you know not to be confused with uh danny you want a fresca you want a fresco caddyshack that's all i can think of when i think prescott how about a frisco uh our greek friend the greek bill mentioned he's like you gotta go to fresco old school the store is kind of amazing i guess not amazing but with the toronto history so it's vietnamese cooks in there who i guess they make pizza in vietnam i didn't know that but they honed their skills there this place used to be called massaminos which was very popular owned by a massamino italian family but all the pizza cooks were vietnamese and the guys the guy who was the cook at massamino's is now in there what happens the massamino the head guy dies the sun takes it over kind of a jerk for lack of better words the staff hates him he hates the staff all the staff quits um and guess what the pizza goes this guy the former cook at massimino's gets a lease right near mass aminos opens up fresca what happens everyone's down the street hey that tastes like the good pizza at massaminos masamino's goes out of business this guy is still here with fresca so he's been making pizza in this city for it sounds like 50 years so uh one bite ever knows the rules i said it the guy looked at goes he's a legend a shout out to the greek he only sends me to legends um here we go it looks like a pretty good pizza now they put they said this is their special stuff the green on it which i forget what he called it actually but um smells like oregano a little bit i don't like telling pizza people what to do give me what you normally do if you didn't know me he didn't know me knew something was going on um one bite ever knows the rules you want to fresco danny this is one of those places i think if you live in toronto you have to be aware of you have to have tried because of the history behind it so here we go one bite everybody knows the rules i don't know how many pizzas you're gonna get from vietnamese legendary pizza makers but here you go so what are the old ones

thank God it didn't and coffee did it and coffee today let's see I'm all nervous not nervous to try it nervous to burn my face Wow big time pizza taste now this one tastes like something you bet by bar beats or you get live in person this does not taste like a frozen pizza I wish it had a little more crisp to it I thought it would I guess that's just the oven game little even a little greasy which you usually don't get you usually don't get the grease factor in frozen pizzas but this one has it Oh blood grease in it early this one has a little like if I patted it down with uh with like some toilet paper I bet you can see some grease yeah big-time so you don't see that all that often with the frozen pizza game but this one you do so hot this is this is honestly the closest that I remember and I keep saying it from buying it at Cape Cod piece of birth cooking in your oven this I feel like tastes kind of like how it did when you got it there very good heavy though it tastes heavy even for bar Peter this tastes heavy greasy heavy I don't know look at this grease for frozen pizza it's interesting I don't know if I could eat this every night some of the others I don't feel as bad about this one I go I'm go 7-2 it's pretty high on that frozen pizza scale it sucked this was a tough one because it tastes the most like store pizza but at the same time it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

1057,"Barstool Pizza Review - Circles and Squares (Philadelphia, PA)",HUETMEZsGmA, [Music] do all right uh pizza review time i don't want to talk pizza review time uh philadelphia first street tulip street circles and squares so circles and squares has been probably all the way last time i was in philly is one of more recommended spots weird hours i think opens at five maybe um on the weekends i'm not sure always at five and you also get to do what we did at the uh one in many yonk um pizza john so what they're doing in covert times you're going to call ahead you go to the website you'll reserve your time slot and now they've got circles and squares you understand let me follow now let me break it down on a very uh primal level circles circular circular round traditional squares i think this is going to be detroit style and it is so they sell way more of the squares than they do the circles i'm not sure which one's more popular i know what you said well if they do more squares the circle is newer i was talking to him first it was more of everybody was just excited for the squares and that's what we used to do so like people just didn't know what the circle was like but now that we've like kind of settled in and we're more neighborhood spot it's a little bit more even yeah we typically do more mostly for like lack of space mostly squares exactly yeah for sure also harder to get like they sold out tonight i had no option it was simply square or go home i think it's fish down you're covering the camera are we good do we need to move good angle um also shout out this is kind of like my philly uh my philly goombah like uh gambling suit anthony or so things of fire one bite everyone knows the rules i'm excited it looks very good well i'm moving in there for the uh review frankie not here so we got kevin on the ones and twos you can kind of tell you can get that one the cameras go a little different that's the move frankie doesn't do one bite and he knows the rules super light very hot they walk it out circles and squares see where we go i'm expecting high things because everyone's been telling me are you waiting on me no no no oh all right do you like the circles of the squares more these days i eat the circles more than see the people are telling me circles circles circles this other guy said circles i'm generally circles but they're known for the square yeah we're known for the squares but oh it's your spot yeah this is my spot literally like you're the owner yeah yeah i just pulled up oh no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah okay well they were good now the pressure gets added because the owner is sitting there looking at me right now you were supposed to come last year with dunphy and uh yeah he was doing blowing it up and all this stuff i've been trying you guys have weird hours so i've been trying to get here forever well do you think don't worry about that that guy says so you but i'm gonna have to come back and try to get very good how hard is it to get a circle slice i mean if you want one we'll make you one right now but it won't be fair because we'll know we're like we're making the best effort how long does it well that that how long did it take 20 minutes maybe a little less all right throw it if you don't mind it all right cool so there we go live that guy kind of got uh bosarian vibes coming down the street if you can catch him without trouble but look so now we get both circles and the squares it's very good heavy you can almost see the grease right there it's a heavy light does that make any sense it's heavy but light like it's fluffy good ingredients but heavy and the focaccia kind of garlic bread on the back and go it's very good seven eight not my favorite style but a very good it's a seven eight on the squares we'll see what i think about the circle the circle is probably lighter um all right we'll wait now i'll get 20 minutes to do nothing how did you get into the pizza game just like a high school job yeah yeah so did you have a different like before you started your own place no i like went to college and tried to work professionally but nothing going on uh-huh so i always knew i could fall back on so where'd you get the recipe from just like trial and error and then no one was doing this fried cheese crust in philly so it was the right time right place cool yeah that was really good here we go thank you how often do you burn your mouth i've gotten a little bit like professional with it so not as much as you'd think hey you wanna take that trash yeah thank you i appreciate it absolutely all right so back to now the circle um which we waited they brought out it's gonna be super hot because i whipped it up i didn't have the reservation oh that's a solid i already know just on looks alone that i'm gonna like this more than square but anybody who knows anything about how i do pizza reviews would already know that super crispy actually has a little artisan feel to it too you can see like the cheese the parmesan like the grated cheese in there super crisp good undercarriage i don't want to burn myself one bite everybody knows the rules the circle from circles and squares which i have very high hopes by how i'm holding this except i don't burn my face still on the heavier side like which always happens with more artisanal pizzas but very good a very good pizza the crisp is unbelievable can you hear the crit i don't want to take a full bite up i hear that crisp now i'm burying myself because i'm a team player i'm trying to illustrate the crisp that you can hear in nebraska very good crush i'll go i don't know eight two a little eight two on the circle pie so we got circle pie eight two that's my jam that's my gig the other one was great the only thing i will say about it is great pizza is even though it's a circle it's still a little bit on the heavier side like this is not a light before you go out to a bar or a date thing this is kind of your in you know maybe for the night very good eight two circles in square so we got an eight two on the circle and we got uh seven eight on the square and it lived up to the height circles and squares philly

the tomato pie now this one's a lot crispier is that because you knew it was me no serve you know my menu says fairly crispy so the cheese one take jesus more because that's what all right that's what

it off and you want you to talk flip-flop and range we'll talk you wanna talk flip-flop and you're looking the flip-flop all right here we go Pizza review we are at Patricia's is name of it right Patricia is Pat's areas we are at where are we Frank what's the address forty six and seventh God doesn't need an introduction Ray Allen and eat we're in here he's goes new book coming out from the outside it says life through basketball and we just started talking he saw Miami Heat hat in the pack is up go the heat he's like do not like the heat he thought New York I told the Boston guy I don't know what I feel about you're right because I am a Boston guy and there's all this we got trash everywhere and the bottom of it may be my gray Allen Jersey because when you went to Miami you broke my heart so I'm thinking in this book we're gonna have about half of it dedicated to an apology to self expanse what about winning at table 7 2008 yeah I understand we won in 2000 a big three we've got per kg and Paul Pierce thought that was our big three over you you have the chance at this time like we're why didn't we go for the second one we tried you know you have talked about organ and our inability to fill the team that was the bill that's all over long period of time like that we lost you 7 la which was a heartbreaker all right read that was another opportunity we just weren't good enough like me sometimes is there's never guarantee look at the Lakers would call Malone and Gary Payton in and Shaq that they end up losing hopefully hated my head and you were such a key part of it you know look at like this it wasn't it wasn't like Boston gets my Henry there was when I left it was now it's time for you to move on because the organization was not valuing me first time in the world my neck Jen we didn't we offer you more than the heat isn't that what I wasn't it wasn't about it wasn't a comparison between what the heat off me about the south of me it was the fact that they weren't offering me what was the measure of what my market value so when I left it wasn't that I left Boston Chocola Miami I'm that Boston and then what was left was I had to choose between Miami Memphis and Minnesota you make the choice what did you did you see so I am a die-hard fossa kid I love the Celtics did you see the reaction because people were pissed including me what did you expect that and you kind of look like you were down here mom had the potential insurance I'd see her that it was like you were a guy with that team you know that was coming up a New Englander behind up and UConn the whole world I think the organization played that against me because they didn't offer me a contract when we ask for conflict at first and you sign everybody else before you come to my table and so now we're sitting here and you give me crumbs you regret how it all went down and I'm not saying it's your fault or their fault I wish you like is that something that you look back like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I wish that thing go down like that no because you know I hate that people are angry disappointed because my time in Boston was incredible as an eight as an athlete you know once you have to decide what go forward so if one door closes you have to figure out okay well where are they going to take me in and appreciated your a Boston guy like you're disappointed because I go but you know I came from somewhere else and now I have to continue whatever it is I didn't do for myself so it is unfortunate the way the sentiment has gone down but it has not like done to me different for me and how I feel about the city of all my time alright so I assume so this in the book and we're gonna get to it's a party yeah that's why I figure this is almost this cathartic but it's good to at least talk them take the slice here's what we do going on through ten take a bite you try it then you give it a score it's actually don't look too bad you said you're a big piece I got pretty good alright so we give it one buy here interesting twang to it no it's got a nice little crunchiness to it and it's not overdone you know I'm like a teacher to go away I don't like it don't unit I do like it well done actually that was don't watch my feet service what on the pizza guy had no pizza doesn't better and move to go cross there even though I don't like to give you any compliments you're my god you want my god you gotta have good for us yeah you don't know that's the important you know so when we talk about this again we can get it in we get out with you eat it do I believe it and so what score I gotta say bye look at the awning the Ottoman port the presentation I hate that you're given a good review I want you to do this Wharf review ever send it I am feeling one thing about me I do my I do my homework so anything I put my I can tell I was saying do you do the homework on the blogs I've written about you good I mean things about you have left I bet you have but I think we both do this to this sharks no I bet you though big collar but you know if you're not doing anything right people are fans don't move no but yeah juice but can I ask a real question yeah do kg and you all hate each other now this I've never hated anybody in my life you know that's the one thing about you know I've gotten to this point because you know all the bad stuff you know I'm a conflict resolution guys so when bad things happen can I look you in the eye and know that you're gonna stand up and fight for me because of what happened because it's not personal right I'm we playing sports but they took that personal yeah they did take a person but it's unfortunate because when you win a champ we had one I've won two championships and all this guy I just walked out the second one well you have and you know that's what sport does for you it's your carry the city on your back yeah I have an opportunity to make brothers these guys are low tension but so and the other day I have I have love for you know it's unfortunate like as you saw I try to get KD pound in the game and obviously we're at you know in battle whatever it may be like he can feel the way he feels but doesn't change what we did and what we meant to the city what the city meant to us do you think I assume that's I know there's he had prior engagements with the Paul Pierce Hawthorne thing does that I mean the reason weren't there had to be because everything that went down right yeah but I wasn't I was never invited and it wasn't I know people made a big deal about me being tall playing golf against Georgia which was completely doing so funny to me because I had no idea that this whole thing was going on in Boston I was in LA for appearance that schedule two months or other so when everybody made to do well you weren't you said you weren't behind me if you you could have gone on it you weren't invited that's I mean it's all the animosity yeah but there's did that wasn't the time to step in when Paul was having his night didn't seven sigh hey guys I'm here you know that was about Paul I appreciate everything he's done you know how he's been who he was to us and to the city and there's still people that are moody yet and you know rightfully so you have the right to feel the way you feel but I love that city but I've gotten so much pushback it's almost like what I did with you guys toward you guys no way beyond meant nothing to anybody it's a Boston attitude it is I mean it's tough it's an interesting situation I'll say this you're this opening the book I will get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what do we got for the score we have the score so you know I've certainly had better pizza I say this is like nothing between the seven and eight somewhere that's a high score seven three seven three that's a high score see if you didn't like I'm actually much lower on that yeah I'm gonna give it a I don't like doing round numbers but everything like it and honor to the guy who probably hates you more than anybody in the world living so I'm giving up five that's a no wasn't was it great was it great but it was an enlightening interview into the trash we go I appreciate it get the book and I was actually really interested I got a pound to that grease upon hiya that's a review Ray Allen one time selfic legend maybe still a future legend we'll see what happens yeah that was a really good review and I appreciate you know one of the interesting I'm gonna die hard ball four trip more polarizing guys one more polarizing guys that I've been watching for its praise yeah you don't have to go over this robbery was so intense and is the heart of it but I appreciate all right it was it was it's more like dad no one ever knows that you don't step up like you want to stepping off the mic like just like as he said to say why did you tell your wife sit right tell me you love me tell me that you want me tell me that you want to put me in a situation get better not like what we gonna do here and there by well you know no it was always that well you know and I like you know by the time they kissed oh yeah sorry so that's the place I love and so fortunate and hardest thing properly I had to do it because I had great time in mind with that right no please I'm your job whatever it is you do on a daily basis they don't cherish you about you you know you sit there you say to yourself wow they spun it I mean they spun it the other way it's like it was the thing everybody's fun yeah and guess who didn't say anything Yeah right yeah so everybody in the whole existence made me look like a criminal making them like I mean I was the mess they did all that then that was the story they thought everything there's so much more which you know I'm talking about

show on the Internet so everybody knows what we do here we try every pizza place in Manhattan until we try them all what do you think there's a rope move to keep this thing together here Arturo's I'm usually gone here to eat this is a little much like a bakery it's a lot it's they're keeping it tight little little something at home by the way for the kids they don't open the kitchen till four napkins on the ground that's on one bite everybody knows the rules here we go that's all of it whole fired pizzas one of it this is my favorite pizzas the city but I've never had it to go I'm just fitting in there to have the slice I know you're a fan of the flop this is gonna be huge flop like an art not bad so you see I hold it right I use the taco but look it's a little bit but it should have a little bit like a tear and a crunch it came a little bit Cheers one bite everybody knows the rules is gonna be piping hot so did you think we've picked this place for you because you were like very happy when we said we're meeting here Frankie picked at the beach Oh Frankie's family owns a pizza shop we're here the book is known from Long Island right shout-out Pirellis one bite every nose rules I can already tell you I'm gonna like this pizza the crust looks like Monty's marble head that's a 10 mm and you know up I'm gonna get whacked at my sins are you gonna always walk behind you and start ripping people you know if I thing is it's it's solid but in my mind's eye I think I remembered it and I usually throw a lot of stuff on have you talked about keeping it very like authentic no and garlic powder or anything else I know you let George Brent had hot pepper but I do let you out hop-hop I feel like off my freaking out we're in see the thing is I need like either a little more salt a little more herb or a little more hot and I'm fine like flavor-wise kind of neutral huh I think it's a pretty good slice one bite everybody knows the rules those remotes Pireaus this is this is now this is a major score from a major TV food guy without without pepper because it is like to cross this great cheese's great but Wow gonna pull slice to hombre there were no rules one bite full slice Wow you wearing this to remind us to go from Brooklyn I am indeed but I love and respect this place it's a great date place and stuff but you're saying by the way the major food problem that I always have it's like you remember place things so good you almost screw it up when you go back but it can't be as good as you'll remember it that seems like what's happening you right a little bit a little bit without the garlic and without the other stuff that I would sprinkle on those are excuses of the cheese the gold-medal slice you agreed with me on that yeah then also the approach the sauce you have like three elements people good olive oil I'm gonna say I know you're looking for a score on this one got it that's the whole reason we're here absolutely I'm gonna weigh homeboy over here's video what's going on man all right good to see if I do by the way how do you produce how you pronounce the name of this street cuz you're definitely you go keep shopping pretty boy go keep shopping don't take any advice go go Cavs that guy I'm gonna say six point seven that was low but you're cool Riddick I think we all got to this is a low score for this pizza Arturo's I have this seven point nine easy I think it's a really good slice I think it's a very good slice at boy sevens not very good score no it's I would like a little more excuse me I'd like a little more salt or a little more spice and again if you let me do a hot pepper because I know you let to be a modification with George yeah but just breath you're like a food guy he's a that guy was amateur hour he's a baseball player I think this is why New York I hate those so much noise all the time if you came along with all these I think you'd have very low scores if you're giving this a six point seven no I think it's a solid slice but don't you find that it's kind of very neutral flavor-wise like it's not like a little on the tanky side I'll go in for another one I'll give it I'll give it another day in court and they were made a slice of pizza I didn't like in fact in honor there is note there is this is like murder you can only be tried once so you already gave the score this covers I'm willing I'm really hey blue Dorothy Hamill like you say they're gonna better than ten and I I came pizza prepared don't hate that yeah check a check of sneaky strong piece of straw pizzas sure we are so strong that could be a holding line [Music] I had something so important to say until Pete's a strong distract me of a great plugin just beautiful just sweet pizza Oh Jose Jose has tangy sauce this is 7.9 it's pretty good look at these guys twins forest that's our best pizza in New York jail J and 16 yeah though have you tried we got to get the final here we got six and by six seven six seven seven nine drastically different live and learn adam richman what how do you even said what did people still buy the man for us we've got yeah but that's cool man like the thing is that that in this especially in my home is stop good stuff wah slice no man III look I that show like gave me opportunities I never dreamed of let me do right by my mom and the way I always wanted to pay off my student loans to get all that was nice huh yeah Bunco al look at it WI be like guys do it this is the long pawn just say went to yell no but I should be so by the way pizza and New Haven fantastic well alright well so

1150,Barstool Pizza Review - Trader Joe's  Frozen Pizza,WW0ylNc7lro, [Music] all right peeps review time Trader Joe's don't don't don't worry about the background noise it looks like a bomb hit my place we got served for we're cleaning it we got a couple of guys where social distancing it's chaos in the streets but pizza goes on I got to trade shows that are sent to me so I go do the eenie meenie miney moe one side the pizza margherita a round one and then on the other it's a kind of like a flat bread cheese and tomato pizza on this one there speaking in French feet yeah mom what a fudgy don't know what got all sorts of language is the language of love is like international being in a food court right now I'm gonna go with this one why just it's straight American language keeping it straight I'm not really buying I guess because no I don't know why they're talking what language is that but I tell ya it is it's like telling you they're talking I'm going with this one it looks better to me in the box so that's a choice Trader Joe's a lot of people said they want to do Trader Joe's it's a big big requested one so we'll see what we got also side note Trader Joe's real quick I'm rarely wrong about anything generally just when the mouth comes out truth gets spit it's like up what David says probably [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] truth Trader Joe's for some reason I grew up thing I was kind of like a scumbag like supermarket like not great and I actually asked people everyone loved Trader Joe's I guess I'm late to the vote so we'll see this is very big if this can live up to whatever on Seine and be some good pizza my whole world will come full circle maybe I'll be at Trader Joe's got one bite every noses alright piece of you time here we go is this camera whatever is it low I don't know we don't know Trader Joe's and then one thing first of all it looks like flow slippy slide a slip and slide all time ploy never got it always asked for it you go down on the yellow thing I never go and I don't know it's one of those urban legends people break their necks or something do they don't they looks pretty good though huh almost like Roman style um I will say Trader Joe's says family size look like what kind of family I mean what kind of fan a man and a wife is that a family because you can't feed more than two people with this this looks like what family size that's misleading so I just got trashed walking the pizza and Thunda from the unboxing of cookie I mean the pizzas a blab everything is blending my life is blending I'm in squalor I live in squalor like I don't baby and just it's like constant [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] squalor and that's as clean as my place has been and probably will be as clean as it will be the duration for the duration was Corona skip quarantine I've lost quarantine or one depending on hopefully out microphones working yeah all right what am I talking about that's it who knows is it Saturday's a Tuesday all I know or all my days have been blended together and I live in trash I just live in squalor I live like I know a hoarder so back to pizza just try to keep your mind straight how do you keep your mind straight when everything is just blending together what you want a light bite I mean I don't even the things that around me you want a weed brownie these are the weed brownies from like last night's unboxing which didn't do much I a weed brownie in the middle Peter ooh is that what you want what am i doing why did I just do that I'm the consummate entertainer that's why not I'm gonna be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] high just getting their own normal brownies quick unboxing update those brownies that we went back and forth it's like all these weed brownies I'll eat them in my own don't weed brownies like they just take like brownies I don't feel nothing I think that we eat brownies I think they were I think weed brownies yeah we are doing an unboxing tonight I'm gonna be high for probably not eat water now I'm talking like I'm on the unbox instead of a piece of you my worlds are just I'm just in squalor Trader Joe's one body buddy knows who looks good little under crust it's kind of like pita bread he looking absolutely looks very good one bite let's see try Joe's I could use some water I actually thought something a little more crisp out of this um it's good when the heels of the weed brownie if it was weed dry very dry the little doughy on the undercarriage which is surprising is such a thin pizza so if you're saying it's a family when I take the family what do you think of four people right mother father daughter brother son four people boy your old parents well one of these at peace feeds the whole thing that's famine that's third world country that's not enough that's so it's a PI bond you need at least three of these for a family I'm gonna be high I mean we shouldn't do that somebody's at the door I'm not saying feel sorry for me but I feel sorry for me that's a man living in squalor Wow 50 million bucks mean my squalor friends weed brownies heard Joe's pizza 50 million bucks important review so concentrated mill the road until five - not as good as expecting when I look at this doesn't have the crisper I wanted I'm five - that's a score I want to be like a newbie or an Arthur or whatever but I think I already feel it

or the what listen you can say you the all that counts right listen to me Josh our state blitz are the main owners I'm with our humble service okay whatever he's here is the Sixers guy also owns fanatics on Tru Lala a whole ton of billionaire we took them to the fancies area we could Canal Street oh I think you counted for jerseys on it they do everything did you read a place for the counterfeiting they do everything they probably are but we're gonna text her as well fanatics I didn't get the invite to the Super Bowl party I got it I was an afterthought Frankie but he's here doing

Frankie all right one bite every knows rules you just take a bite score it one through ten while we do this let me just change a little bit real quick here oh hello Frankie this guy on the card owner the six no can cover the stuff no team in the history of sports is dominating another team quite like the bosses would you get that almond 800 this is real get if an axe no I did not let me say it in front of you let me it's over we beat the Sixers so many times Frankie they are reduced to drop in confetti even when they lose because it's the only that you can do no franchise has dominated another like the Boston Celtics dominate the Sixers and you make your trades you make all your little moves and you still lose at home but I like them I do like you know I look forward to send you this video sometime I won't forget to say the smack you're talking both in our 40s Wiimote both may be dead before that happens okay well site everybody let's go Frankie pick this place buddy I want to take in a billionaire I wouldn't phone score at 1 through 10 6.76 a double I like that six point seven six now I still think that's hi Frankie I don't know what a respecting the dough kind of stinks I'm going I thought was one bite you're really good you better hold up one but you look like jaws I mean I'm well you score sticks first war always sticks what did he give it six point seven haha my brain real real slow I was repeating I'm worried about Marshall I don't parcel they may not work out I took adderall like 20 minutes go it hasn't kicked in yet I'm going with 10 or 20 20 you may be like oh I mean something about hard like that feed of that in slow motion is like ding floor really stood out the best yeah I would go with one point seven one point seven six or one point seven one point seven I think you're underrated this pizza I think you're kind of being like you're just being unfair because we're not maybe if you move you're not that fast me I didn't think there can't step nine the decimal place the point on the 1.7 over one what would you have well you got a point one seven all right we can one point seven but if you move the decimal point you have 17 yeah what number is that that's a review listen you've got opportunity sometimes in life you have to switch teams and I think you could go all in the Sixers get out he doesn't like you boy I said wicks like honestly no he likes Roberts guy he doesn't like now wrong he says okay you treat me the best of any franchise even better than so they put me front row sonic better than it's better than Robert does well rock we have just pick your side Johnny Jonathan Kraft signed our wall the only news organization gets it right 100% of the time that's signed on the wall that's big I'm still I'm still seeing opportunity for you did good make good life choices and fight everything by everything fanatics they send it if I have it on me a fanatics package or where we got listen we're gonna eat your snow jacket so we can do future reviews in the snow it's all gonna be from fanatics we need tons of six your stuff I said I said what the Patriots no cuz those my not my guys no meet Canal is now like a Boston guy so meekest look both of us or both of us are Eagles fans but we don't like when they play each other but Robert Jonathan their family to me so I've always been incredibly loyal so you guys all like a morning we

out the door after you did the greatest thing the city's ever seen so you got a lot of problems at Philly and I will never release it yeah I'm just gonna focus you on fanatics we gotta get everything up in attics we get I'm happy now you new with actually getting we can agree on your license should I use the shop rule Allah so thank you yeah that's I appreciate that huh we also don't guilt now as

subjects the Sixers and the Patriots and the Eagles no no no I'm on everything I'm on everything yeah as long as your fanatics head-to-toe some that you know I'm actually okay deep down if you want to be a Celtics fan and commit your life to it what would you switch your are you are you fun you're from the Philly Erik Lora marriage by way I do my rocker I got to do whatever I got to do it yeah

shark tank i guess it has mozzarella on the inside there's gonna be an absolute disaster to eat he said be careful don't burn your face cheesy meatball as seen on shark tank i don't know if you got

of it she'll keep 10 do we have a deal come on oh yeah here we go i think he got investment i don't think so wouldn't have said as invested and we would have heard of the cheesy meatball there it is though see the mozzarella coming in that must be like you can come right through that must be some sort of unique proprietary meatball information there's a meatball but i think what makes it special is they put the mozzarella in here's a question for all the kids at home what's the difference between just putting it on top like everybody else i think i just blew up the whole thing that's probably i bet i wanted someone shark tank ask that kevin o'leary is like question why just put the cheese on top anyways good meatball [Music] it's going to be boggled 7-4 on the meatball pretty pretty good

the world definitely New York he's like you got to try them so I went in and tell me you got the best of something I'll go try it now here's where it gets complicated we met the place is named is he

what is it ah what are the Philly ones you know Geno's and paps I think I picked Pat's I can't remember really good I'm not just saying that because I like Izzie this is good as Geno's and patta as I recall if you want a Philly cheesesteak this is the best one I've had in New York I haven't had ton of them but this is as good as it gets if you value your arteries you should probably limit these to one a month I don't even know if I put the cheese whiz on it the whiz whip there's a whiz weight on it his wizard on it but did she put the wizard on the side this is a debacle I think you put the

1233,"Barstool Pizza Review - Joey's House of Pizza (Nashville, TN)",WUgUJi6E1sk, [Music] all right spider peace review time uh we got a lot going on here so let me set the backstreet we're at joey's house of pizza right so people knew we were coming to nashville we're doing the boston with the boys will compton he's like you gotta go to joey's gotta go joey's we're coming here he shoots me a taxi goes you're not allowed to go to joey's i'm like what are you talking about you're the one he's like yeah they don't want you it's like well they don't get to choose i'm coming anyway so i went in thinking this could be a bit weird we talked about sending you in so they won't know they knew exactly the whole line knew who i was and they were happy to see us but i can see what they're saying because it's super busy and i think what did we say pick up 11 45 i think it's like 12 10. so they're just kind of on they're they're overworked there's also all family affair so i got i was in there for a while got to talk to him this lady stephanie behind the counter i filmed it i don't know what have i done like three four thousand pizza reviews the fastest mover i've ever seen behind a counter when i say she was going super sonic speed i have the footage she's going i they're not open on the weekends i think just solely so they don't kill her like she's moving that fast it's unbelievable so um they know what i like that's also the first thing i said she looked at me said you're not gonna like my pizza i know you like my pizza whatever we'll see they gave me sicilian style that looks if you're just going looks on a sicilian that's a tent like just looks wise but i'm not a sicilian guy so we'll do that second all right one bite everyone knows rules joey's house of pizza heavy nashville authentic new york i see what she's saying this is kind of a new york look the fresh mod she's put in there i see what she's saying about this not being my style because she's right i like it super skinny super light super like charcoal this isn't it um and maybe that's why she's like he's not welcome here but i was welcome there one bite everyone knows rules you know what i think they said authentic new york style a lot of people in different cities say that this is as authentic new york style as you're gonna get like in terms of trying to get the feel of a big new york slice this is it except way better like traditionally new york slices are greasy and gross the ones that say this isn't i mean it's very good stuff i i don't know how in my eating style to get into the mozzarella but so different than the five points which is like clean and crisp and and like you can eat a million these you guys split with a friend like four slices of these i'm out i'm gonna go for everything going on in there seven seven i got a fair score i think this though i mean look at that they also had a slice called the gladiator which is like a stuffed pizza i think they had pepperoni in it a lot of people ordering it it looked like you take a nap for at least two two years maybe this thing's heavy look at this sicilian if you're going to put a sicilian like just by appearance and museum this is what it would look like who got franklin's not here he loves us all right 7-7 generous on my score because it's not my style but she was moving so fast and won't give her a heart attack this is like an eight five this sicilian not my style i'm not sicilian guy but of all the sicilians i've had this is as good as any sicilian i've ever had so eight five on the sicilian seven seven if i did reverse that may have been a point or two lower like a seven five seven six but seven seven eight five this is spectacular so that's our view i i'm not gonna say to come here because i don't want her to die stephanie and it's all the family but if you're willing to maybe kill a woman come here that's a review thank you have a great day hypersonic speed so what's happened here is we did the review 7-7 is a good score 8-5 is like the best sicilian she got pissed and she's like i want to rematch i've never had that in all my years of doing this i've never had someone demand a rematch but that's what she's asked for she's like you're not going anywhere i told you not to come in the first place so now you can't leave so now i don't know what's happening and her mother was pissed that she said we couldn't come she's like [Music] you can't get a certain styles of pizza you can't get higher with me because they're not my style that's what we have here with the normal i'm just gonna she she's kidding at me for an eight she i thought she's gonna punch me in the face when i said seven seven but usually the whole pie is better than the single usually right here all right all right let's go do it again rematch first ever first ever rematch i'll meet out there spider we'll do it thanks all right rematch slice spider i don't know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that means we've never had a rematch in history doing pizza so what she said stephanie was the slices are different than the whole listen i don't want to get a broken nose and say differently but generally the whole slice is better than the individual individual she says not here maybe because they don't do a whole ton of whole pies because they don't have the time for it i'm having a heart attack um literally that was a mini heart attack i don't know why she gave me four of these all right rematch slice hey all you pizza makers don't get this in your head i'm not giving rematch unless you work as fast and as hard as she does you're not getting a rematch it broke one bite everyone knows rules it's good it tastes the same it broke there um let's get that fresh roots listen there's no pizza in the history of pizza that i've wanted to give an eight one two more than this slice so you got an eight five on the sicilian stephanie you're gonna eight five on the sicilians you come behind me with a crowbar you're going eight five in the system i can't go it's just there's certain pizzas this is one of them it's not my style it doesn't matter how much i love it it can't get to the eight am i gonna raise it because i don't want to get in another fight and have another rematch and this be like uh you know muhammad ali versus joe frazier three the rumble in the jungle i don't want that so i'm gonna go seven eight and that's a peer pressure because she's gonna choke me out if i don't do it so seven eight on the slice seven seven on the whole as a pizza guy if you come here get the sicilian it's an eight five and whatever you do don't look uh stephanie in the eyes and be like i thought it'd be better because she will hold you hostage or noogie to death until you love it so uh that's our view i love this place the whole family works they're all family so it's the mother it's the daughter stephanie the husband and the son almost more than the pizza places like this they're the best and they're hard to find so there's a review nashville joey's house of pizza almost as much as the experience as it is the pizza but both are really good that's a review
